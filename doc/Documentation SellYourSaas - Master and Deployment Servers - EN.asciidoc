== Introduction ==

Sell-Your-Saas is an Open Source project, born out of the need to provide, in real time, Web application instances (like Dolibarr ERP CRM, GLPI, MediaWiki, ...) to end users, for immediate use, with the following requirements:

* Able to manage a very high number of instances and users.
* Very low costs (must be at least 10x lower than Cloud solutions by containers).
* Real-time deployment.
* Offer full and private access to the proposed application, including administration, with full access without restricting functionality or configuration.
* Offer optionaly a 100% open SaaS, with SSH, SFTP and direct database access to users.
* Multi-language.

Following the deployment of v1 and at the request of users to perpetuate their instance via a subscription, the platform evolved to add other objectives:

* Take into account the subscription to the application offered in the form of paid subscriptions.
* Dedicated customer area for managing these invoices, accounts and support.
* 100% automated system (from the arrival of the prospect to the termination of his subscription through the delivery of the service, backups, supervision and supply of accounting: no human intervention).
* Flexibility in the subscription mode (frequency, prices, additional service, options, ...)
* Compatible (or at least adaptable) with any Web application.
* Management of a reseller network.
* Available in OpenSource.

Funded by the Open Source companies https://www.dolicloud.com [DoliCloud] and https://www.teclib.com [TecLib], SellYourSaas v2 has achieved these objectives and is now in production for several companies offering Saas services (https://www.dolicloud.com[DoliCloud], https://www.novafirstcloud.com[NovaFirstCloud], https://www.glpi-network.cloud[GLPI-Network], https://www.doliondemand.fr[DoliOnDemand],...). Here is a summary of its capabilities:

* Deployment of any WAMP application. Management of multiple solutions / different applications at the same time.
* Free distribution of proceedings without request for confidential information or credit card.
* Distribution of paid instances with different pricing levels.
* Ready-to-use showcase website (optional) to sell your application.
* Dedicated customer area (invoicing, ticket, customer account).
* Pre-wired for supervision via DataDog.
* Pre-wired for performance analysis, conversion rate via Web Analytics tools (Google Analytics, Matomo, ...).
* Payment by credit or debit card via Stripe, SCA (Strong Customer Authentication) compliant.
* Payment by SEPA direct debit (but no direct interface to submit SEPA files to the bank).
* Anti-abuse systems for applications.
* Instance subscription quota systems.
* Tools facilitating maintenance, customer support, application updates.
* Management of a reseller network. Dedicated reseller area (invoicing, customer account).
* Infrastructure cost per instance <30 cents (Cost observed on the DoliCloud sales department providing Dolibarr ERP CRM).
* ...
     

The project has been available as a community project since 2020 on GitHub: https://github.com/dolicloud/sellyoursaas

It is composed:

    * From an extension module to the excellent Open Source Dolibarr ERP CRM (https://www.dolibarr.org).
    * Various system tools.
    * Installation and system configuration documentation (this documentation).


This document presents the steps for implementing your own SaaS business platform.

<<<<

== Choice and acquisition of a domain name

The entire service will run on a domain name. In the rest of the document, we will use the value *mysaasdomainname.com*
You need to acquire this domain name from a registrar.

== Installation of the machine and OS

The first step is to make one (or more) server available. If we are going on several servers, one will be *Master* server (management and invoicing) and the others will be *Deployment servers* (customer instances). The *Master* server can also be *Deployment server*, it is possible to start with a single server.

=== Choice of machine and OS and create it

* Obtain a server with SSH access that can pass root (We will use Ubuntu LTS minimum *16.04* or *18.04* or *20.04*) for the *Master server*.

* Obtain one or more servers with SSH access that can pass root (We will use Ubuntu LTS minimum *16.04* or *18.04* or *20.04*) for the *Deployment server(s)*. Note: This point can be ignored if you decide that the Deployment server will be the same server as the Master server (not recommended in production).

_Example with Amazon Standard Medium:_

Server *m1.medium* hosted in EU @ $ 0.18 per hour plus $ 10 for storage and bandwidth then switch to *m1.large* @ $ 0.18 per hour

_Example with OVH Public Cloud:_
 
For the master server: A 4 GB memory minimum server with 2 CPU minimum.
For the deployment server(s), for 500 instances: A 8 GB memory minimum server with 4 CPU minimum - Cost in 2020: 30 euros / month.

=== Choice a Hostname for the server(s) and set it

* Add an entry for the new server to the DNS provided by the domain provider.
This is done by adding an entry into the DNS zone of domain *mysaasdomainname.com*

[source,bash]
---------------
type=A
name=nameofserver.mysaasdomainname.com
ip=ipv4.of.the.server

type=AAAA
name=nameofserver.mysaasdomainname.com
ip=ipv6:of:the:server
---------------

Where nameofserver can be "admin" for a master server, "withX" for a deployment server but can also be any name of your choice.


* Go to the server provider management interface, to add this name as the reverse name of the server IP.


* Go to the server provider management interface, to modify the short name of the server. This may modify the */etc/hostname* file automatically (if not manually modified) with this short name. The file will then have as sole content:

[source, bash]
---------------
nameofserver
---------------


Connect and modify the file */etc/hosts* with the entry of the new server:

[source, bash]
---------------
main.ip.of.server nameofserver.mysaasdomainname.com
127.0.0.1  nameofserver
---------------



[[adding_a_disk]]
=== Adding the hard disk for data (home of user instances and home of backups)

On *Deployment server* :

We will add, on the *Deployment servers*, an independent disk for user instances and backups. It can be 1 disk for the 2 or 2 different disks.

With OVH Public Cloud:

* Create the data disk. On a deployment server, you can imagine to reserve 250MB for each customer instance so choose a size in consideration.


* Associate the disk with the server (each additional disk is added in /dev/vdb, /dev/vdc, /dev/vdd, ...).
Note, the disk becomes visible with *fdisk -l* and *lsblk*


* If the disk is not partitioned, add the partition on the disk (Linux type) and format it by doing:

[source, bash]
---------------
fdisk -l
fdisk /dev/vdx
option n then p (then choose the partition number, first and last sector) then w

fdisk -l

fsck -N /dev/vdxY
mkfs.btrfs /dev/vdxY      (you can also use mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdxY)
---------------

Whether the disk has just been formatted or whether it is an added disk already formatted, the rest of the procedure is identical:


* Recover the value of the UUID at the end of the formatting which is displayed, otherwise, recover it with the command 

[source, bash]
---------------
blkid
---------------

If the disk was created by cloning another one, you must change the UUID of the new disk to avoid to have twice the same UUID on 2 differents disks.

[source, bash]
---------------
tune2fs -U $(uuidgen) /dev/vdxY
blkid
---------------


* Declare the mount point for an automatic mounting at each reboot by adding a line in */etc/fstab*

[source, bash]
---------------
UUID=94817f83-a2ad-46c4-81e0-06e6dd0e95f1 /mnt/diskX btrfs defaults 0 0
or
UUID=94817f83-a2ad-46c4-81e0-06e6dd0e95f1 /mnt/diskX btrfs noatime,nofail 0 0     #does not block the server from starting
---------------


* Mount disk

[source, bash]
---------------
mkdir /mnt/diskhome
mount /dev/vdxY /mnt/diskhome
mkdir /mnt/diskbackup

And only if a disk was created (optionnel) for the backup:
mount /dev/vdxZ /mnt/diskbackup

blkid
---------------

Note: A reboot may be required if disk or mount is not visible.


* Optimize the filesystem by removing the update of the "atime" read access

To see options for optimizing filesystems:

[source, bash]
---------------
tune2fs -l /dev/vdxY | grep features
---------------
return

Filesystem features: has_journal ext_attr resize_inode dir_index filetype needs_recovery extent flex_bg sparse_super large_file huge_file uninit_bg dir_nlink extra_isize


To add -noatime to the filesystem in the */etc/fstab* file:

[source, bash]
---------------
UUID=94817f83-a2ad-46c4-81e0-06e6dd0e95f1 /mnt/diskX btrfs noatime,nofail 0 0
---------------

To take the change into account:

[source, bash]
---------------
mount -o remount /dev/diskX/
---------------

To check:

[source, bash]
---------------
cat /proc/mounts | grep diskX
---------------


* Optimize the memory for a lot of inode and dentry

You can run *slabtop* to get information on number of inodes/dentries and *cat /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure* to see cache pressure.
We want to reduce cache pressure to 50 instead of 100 to increase priority in memory use for inodes versus page contents.

[source, bash]
---------------
vi /etc/sysctl.conf

#fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1024000
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50

sysctl -w vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50

cat /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure
---------------



Note: If you need to recover data files from another source disk, use:

[source, bash]
---------------
rsync --info=progress2 -au sourceServer:/mnt/sourceDisk /mnt/targetDisk

Example:
cd /mnt/diskSource
rsync --info=progress2 --exclude 'dbn*' -au -e 'ssh' . loginuser@myserverdest.mydomain.com:/var/lib/mysql
chown -R mysql.mysql /var/lib/mysql
After launching mysql, you can test all databases with
mysqlcheck --all-databases
---------------



=== SSH and sudo

==== Unix admin account

Create the user account *admin*. It will be used to install and administer the system when root is not required.

[source, bash]
---------------
groupadd admin; useradd -m -g admin admin;
mkdir /home/admin/logs; chown root.admin /home/admin/logs; chmod 770 /home/admin/logs;
mkdir /mnt/diskbackup; chown admin.admin /mnt/diskbackup
mkdir /home/admin/backup; chown admin.admin /home/admin/backup;
mkdir /home/admin/backup/conf; chown admin.admin /home/admin/backup/conf;
mkdir /home/admin/backup/mysql; chown admin.admin /home/admin/backup/mysql;
mkdir /home/admin/wwwroot; chown admin.admin /home/admin/wwwroot
---------------

Check in /etc/passwd that the id of this user *admin* is greater than or equal to 1000.


Create a user account for yourself (or other administrators), for example: *myunixlogin*. It will be used to log in.

[source, bash]
---------------
adduser myunixlogin
---------------

==== Default shell

Modify the default shell to use bash (instead of dh sh or dash)

[source, bash]
---------------
ln -fs /bin/bash /usr/bin/sh
---------------

Or for Ubuntu 18.04

[source, bash]
---------------
ln -fs /bin/bash /bin/sh
---------------


==== SSH setup

Fix permission on */etc/ssh/sshd_config* so only root has read and write access:

[source,conf]
---------------
chmod go-rw /etc/ssh/sshd_config
---------------


Create a file */etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/sellyoursaas.conf* to change login permissions with the following content:

For Ubuntu 18.04: you can concat the content into file *sshd_config*, but be sure to not have duplicate values.

[source, conf]
---------------
# Privilege Separation is turned on for security
#UsePrivilegeSeparation yes
# Permissions on files must be correct to allow login
StrictModes yes

Port 22

# MaxAuthTries 6
MaxAuthTries 10
# MaxSessions 10
MaxSessions 25

# Disallow login to root
PermitRootLogin no
# Disallow empty passwords
PermitEmptyPasswords no
# Do not support the "keyboard-interactive" authentication scheme defined in RFC-4256.
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

# Define list of allowed method to authenticate
PasswordAuthentication no   # This will be allowed for osu users only into main sshd_config file with a Match User rule
PubkeyAuthentication yes

DenyUsers guest

AuthorizedKeysFile     .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys_support

# Legacy changes - To allow an old client (like old PHP) to connect to
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +aes128-cbc

ClientAliveInterval 30
#ClientAliveCountMax 3

AllowUsers admin osu*
AllowUsers myunixlogin

---------------

Please note: replace *myunixlogin* with the correct value before taking changes into account with:



Now add this at end of file */etc/ssh/sshd_config* (ssh does not allow Match Rules into the custom file)

[source, conf]
---------------
# BEGIN Block for SellYourSaas
# Warning Match rule works only insshd_config not into include files
# You can test a Match User rule with ssd -T -C user=aaa | grep param
#Match User osu*
#  ChrootDirectory "/home/jail/home/"
#  ForceCommand /usr/bin/secureBash
#Match User osu*
#  ChrootDirectory %h
Match User osu*
  PasswordAuthentication=yes
# END Block for SellYourSaas
---------------

To test a ssh config, you can run

[source, conf]
---------------
sshd -T -C user=mylogin -C host=clienthost -C addr=clientaddr
---------------

Then reload ssh 

[source, conf]
---------------
/etc/init.d/ssh reload
---------------


Add the following line in the */etc/sudoers* file to reposition the HOME according to the user after a sudo -s:

[source, conf]
---------------
Defaults set_home
---------------

Create a file */etc/sudoers.d/myunixlogin* with the content

[source, conf]
---------------
myunixlogin ALL=(ALL) ALL
# You can also add this lines to avoid users to re-enter a password when switching to 'admin' or 'osu*'
#myunixlogin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/su - admin
#myunixlogin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/su - osu*
---------------

This allows you to switch to *admin* or *osu...* without typing your password too:

[source, bash]
---------------
sudo su - admin
sudo su - osu...
---------------


And set the *root*.*root* and the permissions *r--r-----*

[source, conf]
---------------
chmod a-w /etc/sudoers.d/myunixlogin
chmod o-r /etc/sudoers.d/myunixlogin
---------------


Test that you can connect using *myunixlogin* and you can make a sudo with

[source,bash]
---------------
ssh -v myunixlogin@x.y.z.a
sudo -s
---------------


Add your public key to your unix account.

[source, bash]
---------------
ssh-copy-id myunixlogin@x.y.z.a
---------------


Define or redefine the password for *root*, *admin* with a secure password.

[source,bash]
---------------
passwd root
passwd admin
---------------

Run *ssh-keygen* for all these acounts : *root*, *admin* and *myunixlogin*


=== Deletion of information files at login

In order not to give information to users doing SSH, on the deployment servers:

[source, bash]
---------------
rm /etc/update-motd.d/10-help-text /etc/update-motd.d/20-runabove 
rm /etc/update-motd.d/50-landscape-sysinfo /etc/update-motd.d/9*-update*-available /etc/update-motd.d/92-unattended-upgrades
---------------

Ignore error on missing files.


=== Modification of /etc/skel

Edit the contents of */etc/skel* on the deployment servers in order to fill in the *.ssh/authorized_keys_support* with

* the ssh public key of the user(s) *myunixlogin*
* the ssh public key of the user *admin* of the master server

[source, bash]
---------------
sudo mkdir /etc/skel/.ssh
sudo touch /etc/skel/.ssh/authorized_keys_support
sudo chmod -R go-rwx /etc/skel/.ssh
sudo vi /etc/skel/.ssh/authorized_keys_support
---------------

Thus any new linux account created (those of customer instances) will be accessible by the administrator(s).

Also create a per-user mysql configuration file in */etc/skel/.my.cnf* to enable SellYourSaas end users to use the
mysql client from their ssh shell connection.

[source, bash]
---------------
printf '[client]\nprotocol=tcp' >> /etc/skel/.my.cnf
---------------


=== Add alias

Add at the end of */etc/bash.bashrc*:

[source, bash]
---------------
alias psld='ps -fax -eo user:12,pid,ppid,pcpu,pmem,vsz:12,size:12,tty,start_time:6,utime,time,cmd'
---------------



=== Added support for IP v6 (optional, if ipv6 wanted but not yet enabled)

==== With ifupdown (Ubuntu 16.04)

- To add a v6 IP dynamically for testing purposes at first:

[source, bash]
---------------
ip addr add 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1234/128 dev eth0
ip -6 route add 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1 dev eth0
ip -6 route add default via 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1 dev eth0
---------------

- For a persistent reboot definition, declare the interface in */etc/network/interfaces* or in a file in */etc/network/interfaces.d* (Ubuntu <17.10)

Example for an IPv6 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1234 with as gateway 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1

[source, conf]
---------------
# To declare a persistent v6 IP (the mask is 128 at OVH in ipv6)
iface eth0 inet6 static
        address 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1234
        netmask 128
        post-up /sbin/ip -6 route add 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1 dev eth0
        post-up /sbin/ip -6 route add default via 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1 dev eth0
        pre-down /sbin/ip -6 route del default via 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1 dev eth0
        pre-down /sbin/ip -6 route del 2002:41d0:1234:1000::1 dev eth0
---------------

Rem: *eth0* can be something else, for example *ens3*.

To take this into account, try this, otherwise, reboot.

[source, bash]
---------------
/etc/init.d/networking restart
---------------

==== With netplan (Ubuntu 18.04 +)

Add a conf file */etc/netplan/51-ipv6-ovh.yaml*.
Note: OVH provides a /128 for ipv6 but netplan wants /64
 
Example for an IPv6 1234:41d0:1234:1000::1234 with as gateway 1234:41d0:1234:1000::1

[source, conf]
---------------
network:
	version: 2
	ethernets:
		eth0:
			match:
				name: eth0
			addresses:
				- "1234:41d0:1234:1000::1234/64"
			gateway6: "1234:41d0:1234:1000::1"
---------------
Note: Use 4 spaces for tabulation.
 
[source, bash]
---------------
netplan try
netplan apply
---------------

Rem: *eth0* can be something else, for example *ens3*.


=== Add virtual IP (optional)

- Add the virtual IP via the OVH manager.

- Add and remove the virtual network interface on the server dynamically (for test).

Addition:

[source, bash]
---------------
ifconfig eth0: 0 a.b.c.d
---------------

Deletion:

[source, bash]
---------------
ifconfig eth0: 0 down
---------------

- For a persistent reboot definition, declare the interface in */etc/network/interfaces* or in a file in */etc/network/interfaces.d* (Ubuntu <17.10)

Example for 2 virtual IPs:

[source, conf]
---------------
auto eth0: 0
iface eth0: 0 inet static
            address a.b.c.d
            netmask 255.255.255.255
            broadcast a.b.c.d

# To declare a persistent virtual IP
auto eth0: 1
iface eth0: 1 inet static
            address e.f.g.h
            netmask 255.255.255.255
            broadcast e.f.g.h
---------------

Rem: *eth0* can be something else, for example *ens3*.

To take this into account, try this, otherwise, reboot.

[source, bash]
---------------
/etc/init.d/networking restart
---------------

- Associate the virtual IP with the server from the OVH manager.


=== Addition of a swap (optional)

Check if swap exists:

[source, bash]
---------------
swapon --summary
---------------

Add a swap on */swap/swap.img* if the disk is not SSD, otherwise on the non SSD disk */mnt/sdX/swap/swap.img*. If all the disks are SSD, do not swap.

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-virtual-memory-swap-file-on-a-vps#4


=== Addition of a filesystem for logs (optional)

Add a new disk of 500 Mb and mount it on */mnt/disklog* or create a virtual mount.

Then modify the file */etc/apache2/envvars* to set *export APACHE_LOG_DIR=/mnt/disklog/*

Delete the dir */home/admin/logs* and replace it with a symbolic link to */mnt/disklog*

Restart Apache. All apache log files of Apache are now stored into */mnt/disklog*.


=== Creation of working directories

On the *Master* server and the *Deployment* servers, create the directories to store backups and archives.

Create directories required to store data, backups and archives:

* Create directory */mnt/diskbackup/backup*:

If you have created a dedicated disk for the backup:

[source, bash]
---------------
mkdir /mnt/diskbackup/backup
---------------

If you haven't:

[source, bash]
---------------
mkdir /mnt/diskhome/backup; chown admin /mnt/diskhome/backup;
ln -fs /mnt/diskhome/backup /mnt/diskbackup/backup
---------------

* Create the other directories on the deployment server:

[source, bash]
---------------
mkdir /home/jail; mkdir /mnt/diskhome/home;

mkdir /mnt/diskbackup/archives-test; mkdir /mnt/diskbackup/archives-paid
mkdir -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/spam;
chown admin.root /mnt/diskbackup/backup /mnt/diskbackup/archives-test /mnt/diskbackup/archives-paid
ln -fs /mnt/diskhome/home /home/jail/home
ln -fs /mnt/diskbackup/backup /home/jail/backup 
ln -fs /mnt/diskbackup/archives-test /home/jail/archives-test 
ln -fs /mnt/diskbackup/archives-paid /home/jail/archives-paid
---------------


=== Getting files of Dolibarr and SellYourSaas application

On all servers (*Master and Deployment*):

* Under the *root* login, install git tool:

[source,bash]
---------------
apt install git
---------------

* Under the *admin* account, retrieve the sources of *Dolibarr* (v16 or +) to be placed in */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr*

[source,bash]
---------------
cd /home/admin/wwwroot
git clone https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr dolibarr --branch x.y
chown -R admin.admin /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr
---------------

* Under login *admin*, install the sources of *SellYourSaas* : Get the sources of the project to place them into */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas*

[source,bash]
---------------
cd /home/admin/wwwroot
git clone https://github.com/dolicloud/sellyoursaas dolibarr_sellyoursaas 
---------------


=== Creation of sellyoursaas.conf with credentials

* Create a file */etc/sellyoursaas.conf* on the server (on the server *Master* and the *Deployment servers*)

[source,bash]
---------------
vi /etc/sellyoursaas.conf
chown root.admin /etc/sellyoursaas.conf
chmod g-wx /etc/sellyoursaas.conf
chmod o-rwx /etc/sellyoursaas.conf
---------------

With the following content:

---------------

Put *masterserver* to 1, *dnsserver* and *instanceserver* to 0 on the Master
Put *masterserver* to 0, *dnsserver* and *instanceserver* to 1 on deployment servers.
Do not forget to set a value for *databasepass*. We will reuse this value later.


* Create a file */etc/sellyoursaas-public.conf* on the server (on the server *Master* and the *Deployment servers*)

[source,bash]
---------------
vi /etc/sellyoursaas-public.conf
chown root.admin /etc/sellyoursaas-public.conf
chmod a+r /etc/sellyoursaas-public.conf
chmod a-wx /etc/sellyoursaas-public.conf
---------------

With the following content:

[source,conf]
---------------
# File /etc/sellyoursaas-public.conf

# Options for antispam system
maxemailperday=50
maxemailperdaypaid=500

# Option to use a different path for spam (for public script)
#pathtospamdir=/tmp/spam
---------------


* Create also an empty directory:

[source,conf]
---------------
mkdir -p /etc/sellyoursaas.d
---------------


* Optional: If you want to restrict access to some IP (to the web admin on *Master server* or to ssh or mysql to the *Deployment servers*), you can also
create a file */etc/sellyoursaas.d/**-allowed-ip.conf* (http, ssh and mysql) or */etc/sellyoursaas.d/**-allowed-ip-ssh.conf* (ssh only) or */etc/sellyoursaas.d/**-allowed-ip-mysql.conf* (mysql only) 

[source,conf]
---------------
# File /etc/sellyoursaas.d/xxx-allowed-ip-zzz.conf

# User 1
Require ip ip.user.1
# User 2
Require ip ip.user.2
---------------

Once such a file is created/removed or modified, you must run the *scripts/firewallsellyoursaasufx.sh* to have the change taken into account on the firewall.


=== Installing the nfs share

NFS sharing will allow the *Deployment* servers to recover the application images to be installed which are centralized on the
*Master* server.

==== On the Master server

Install the NFS server and share on */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas*

[source, bash]
---------------
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
vi /etc/exports
---------------

[source, bash]
---------------
# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas i.p.deployment.server1(ro,no_root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
...
/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas i.p.deployment.serverN(ro,no_root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
---------------

Note that you should have n lines (one per deployment server) in this file.

Set a fixed port for mountd:

[source, bash]
---------------
vi /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server
---------------

and comment out this line: RPCMOUNTDOPTS=--manage-gids, add this instead: 

[source, bash]
---------------
RPCMOUNTDOPTS="--port 33333"
---------------

[source, bash]
---------------
service nfs-config restart
service nfs-kernel-server restart
rpcinfo -p
---------------

You should see mountd on port 33333. If not, restart server.

[source, bash]
---------------
exportfs -v -a (to validate new entries to add)
exportfs -v -r (to validate new entries to remove)
exportfs
systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server
systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
systemctl status nfs-kernel-server
exportfs
---------------


==== On the Deployment Servers

Be sure to have firewall open between the NFS client (*Deployment server*) and the NFS server (*Master server*). 
Note: The firewall will be installed later.

Install the NFS client and install it manually. Editing is performed by default in NFSv4.

[source, bash]
---------------
sudo apt install nfs-common
sudo mount -t nfs i.p.server.master:/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas
sudo umount /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas
---------------

Add the line to the */etc/fstab* file to have automatic reboot mounting

[source, bash]
---------------
i.p.server.master:/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas  nfs  defaults 0 0
---------------

and try the automatic mount
 
[source, bash]
---------------
mount -a
---------------

=== Deploy the public key of master admin on deployment admin account

==== On deployment servers

On the deployment servers, copy the public and private key of the master's ssh *admin* account to */home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa_sellyoursaas...* (This couple of key file is the one common for maintenance to access osu... user accounts). Set the right permissions.

[source, bash]
---------------
chmod u+rw /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa_sellyoursaas*
chmod go-rw /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa_sellyoursaas*
chmod a+r /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa_sellyoursaas.pub
---------------


Complete the file */home/admin/.ssh/config* to indicate to use this public key when accessing to itself or github instead of *id_rsa* by default.

[source, bash]
---------------
Host ip.server.deployment
    IdentityFile /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa_sellyoursaas
Host github.com
    IdentityFile /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa_sellyoursaas    
---------------

* Installation of the 22.04+ Ubuntu packages

[source,bash]
---------------
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y systemd-timesyncd git gzip zip zstd memcached ncdu duc acl ufw sudo
sudo apt install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client
sudo apt install -y apache2 apache2-bin lynx
sudo apt install -y php php-cli libapache2-mod-php php-fpm php-gd php-imap php-json php-ldap php-mysql php-curl php-memcached php-imagick php-intl php-xml php-zip php-bz2 php-ssh2 php-mbstring php-dev libmcrypt-dev

sudo apt install -y fail2ban
sudo apt install -y libreoffice-common libreoffice-writer
sudo apt install -y mailutils postfix
---------------


=== Disabling automatic update

Uninstall the package *unattended-upgrades* if it was installed.

[source, bash]
---------------
apt remove unattended-upgrades
---------------


=== Max size increase UID

On the deployment servers, modify */etc/login.defs* as follows:

[source, conf]
---------------
UID_MIN                  1000
UID_MAX                 500000

GID_MIN                  1000
GID_MAX                 500000
---------------

Modify the file */etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mpm_itk.conf* (if it exists) or */etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf* (otherwise)

[source, conf]
---------------
LimitUIDRange 1 500000
LimitGIDRange 1 500000
---------------


=== Apache web server configuration

Enable apache *modules* to work with MPM_PREFORK and MPM_ITK:

[source,bash]
---------------
a2enmod actions alias asis auth_basic auth_digest authn_anon authn_dbd authn_dbm authn_file authz_dbm authz_groupfile authz_host authz_owner authz_user autoindex
a2enmod cache cgid cgi charset_lite dav_fs dav dav_lock dbd deflate dir dump_io env expires ext_filter file_cache filter headers http2 ident include info ldap
a2enmod mem_cache mime mime_magic negotiation reqtimeout rewrite setenvif speling ssl status substitute suexec unique_id userdir usertrack vhost_alias
a2enmod mpm_itk mpm_prefork
a2enmod php7.0|php7.2|php7.4|php8.1
---------------

Enable apache *configurations* to work with MPM_PREFORK and MPM_ITK:

[source,bash]
---------------
a2enconf charset localized-error-pages other-vhosts-access-log security
---------------


On the *Deployment servers*:

* Create the directory of the configuration files of the virtual hosts of the instances.

[source, bash]
---------------
cd /etc/apache2
mkdir sellyoursaas-available sellyoursaas-online sellyoursaas-offline
ln -fs /etc/apache2/sellyoursaas-online /etc/apache2/sellyoursaas-enabled
---------------

* On Ubuntu 18.04 and +, check that the *PrivateTmp* parameter is *false* in the *apache2.service* Apache launch configuration. This will make it possible to have a directory */tmp* which is not unique and not isolated to each instance, making debugging and analysis operations possible on the problems of sending emails and controlling spam. It also allows to send antivirus into a separate process on uploaded files that are stored into this temporary directory.

[source, bash]
---------------
vi /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/apache2.service
systemctl daemon-reload;
/usr/sbin/apachectl stop;
/usr/sbin/apachectl start;
/usr/sbin/apachectl status;
---------------

Note: Reload of apache seems not enough so we stop/start it.

* Add the directive to take into account the directory for the *virtual hosts* of the user instances in the config */etc/apache2/apache2.conf*

[source, conf]
---------------
# Include virtual host for sellyoursaas instances:
IncludeOptional sellyoursaas-enabled/*.conf
---------------

* Add directives to define the default error log in */etc/apache2/conf-enabled/other-vhosts-access-log.conf*

[source, conf]
---------------
ErrorLogFormat "[%v] [%{u}t] [%-m:%l] [pid %P:tid %T] %7F: %E: [client\ %a] %M% ,\ referer\ %{Referer}i"
ErrorLog "|/usr/bin/rotatelogs -t ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/other_vhosts_error.log 1G"
---------------



On the *Master server*:

* Create the file */etc/apache2/.htpasswd* with 

[source, bash]
---------------
htpasswd -cm /etc/apache2/.htpasswd <wanted login>
---------------
Choose a password. You will need to give this couple login/password to anyone who wants to access the backoffice *admin.mysaasdomainname.com* .


* Create a virtual host file */etc/apache2/sites-available/admin.mysaasdomainname.com.conf* for *admin.mysaasdomainname.com* on the Dolibarr *Master* for the administration of SellyourSaas

[source, bash]
---------------

=== Timeout of server launches

On Ubuntu 18.04+ when MariaDb has been migrated from a MySql:

Increase the timeout for launching processes because sometimes mysql / mariadb can take a long time to restart after a crash. 
To do this, modify the file */etc/systemd/system/mariadb.service.d/migrated-from-my.cnf-settings.conf* and put

[source, bash]
---------------
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec = 3600s
TimeoutStopSec = 3600s
---------------

Note: Instead of putting *3600s*, it is possible to put *infinity* (but 3600 is preferred)

Then reload the new configuration:

[source, bash]
---------------
systemctl reload service_name.service
or
systemctl stop mysqld.service
systemctl start mysqld.service
---------------


=== Installation of the firewall ===

TODO Graphic with flux and ports...


* Add a firewall with ufw:

Edit file */etc/ufw/before.rules* to allow out ping, by adding this:

[source, bash]
---------------
# allow outbound icmp
-A ufw-before-output -p icmp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
-A ufw-before-output -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
---------------

Then launch and enable the firewall

[source, bash]
---------------
/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/firewallsellyoursaasufw.sh start
---------------


=== Installation of unix watchdog (optional) ===

* Installation and activation of watchdog Linux with configs in */etc/watchdog*

[source,bash]
---------------
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/repair.ksh /usr/sbin/repair
---------------

To consult, disable at startup, enable at startup, stop, launch respectively:

[source, bash]
---------------
systemctl status watchdog
systemctl disable watchdog
systemctl enable watchdog
systemctl stop watchdog
systemctl start watchdog
---------------

When load become very high or when memory is very low, the watchdog will launch the repair script that will track status of server into files */var/log/repair...log* and then reboot the server. Note: This should never happen.


=== Installation of the Apache watchdog ===

Required to compensate an apache bug making apache dying after a too high number of reload.

On the *Deployment servers* :

* Installation and activation of the apache watchdogs provided in */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/* by creating a link by

[source, bash]
---------------
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/apache_watchdog_launcher1.sh /etc/init.d/apache_watchdog_launcher1
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/apache_watchdog_launcher2.sh /etc/init.d/apache_watchdog_launcher2

ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/smtp_watchdog_launcher1.sh /etc/init.d/smtp_watchdog_launcher1
systemctl daemon-reload

systemctl enable apache_watchdog_launcher1;
systemctl is-enabled apache_watchdog_launcher1;
systemctl status apache_watchdog_launcher1;

systemctl enable apache_watchdog_launcher2;

systemctl status apache_watchdog_launcher3;

systemctl enable smtp_watchdog_launcher1;
systemctl is-enabled smtp_watchdog_launcher1;
systemctl status smtp_watchdog_launcher1;
---------------


=== Installation of the instance deployment agent ===

On the *Deployment servers* :

* Agent installation and activation in */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/remote_server_launcher.sh* by creating a link by

[source, bash]
---------------
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/remote_server_launcher.sh /etc/init.d/remote_server_launcher
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable remote_server_launcher
systemctl is-enabled remote_server_launcher
systemctl status remote_server_launcher
---------------

Note: The agent is launched on port 8080 and is waiting master orders.


To use systemd create a file */etc/systemd/system/remote-server-launcher.service* :

[source,bash]
---------------
# /etc/systemd/system/remote-server-launcher.service
[Unit]
 Description=Remote Server Launcher
 RequiresMountsFor=/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas

[Service]
 Type=forking
 ExecStart=/etc/init.d/remote_server_launcher start
 TimeoutSec=0
 StandardOutput=tty
 RemainAfterExit=yes
 Restart=on-failure

[Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target
---------------

The "RequiresMountsFor" directive allows us to wait for the directory of "remote_server_launcher.sh" to be available.

Service activation :

[source,bash]
---------------
systemctl enable remote-server-launcher.service
systemctl start remote-server-launcher.service
systemctl status remote-server-launcher.service
systemctl stop remote-server-launcher.service
---------------


=== Installation of fail2ban ===

* Installation of fail2ban and activation of the following fail2ban rules:

We will enable some generic fail2ban rules:

  *apache-shellshock*, *php-url-fopen*, *pam-generic*, *postfix-sasl*, *mysqld-auth*, *xinetd-fail*
  *apache-badbots*, *apache-noscript*, *apache-overflows*, *apache-nohome*, *apache-botsearch*

As well as the specific rules for sellyoursaas:
  
  *email-dol-blacklist*, *email-dol-perday*, *email-dol-perhour*, *email-dol-perhouradmin*
  *web-accesslog-limit403*,
  *web-dol-passforgotten*, *web-dol-bruteforce*, *web-dol-limitpublic*, *web-dol-registerinstance*

NOTE: The rules available may vary depending on the version of the OS installed.


To do this, first create a */etc/fail2ban/jail.local* file with this content:


[source, bash]
---------------
# Fail2Ban configuration file.
#
# This file was composed for Debian systems from the original one
# provided now under /usr/share/doc/fail2ban/examples/jail.conf
# for additional examples.
#
# Comments: use '#' for comment lines and ';' for inline comments
#
# To avoid merges during upgrades DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE
# and rather provide your changes in /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
#

# The DEFAULT allows a global definition of the options. They can be overridden
# in each jail afterwards.

[DEFAULT]
# "ignoreip" can be an IP address, a CIDR mask or a DNS host. Fail2ban will not
# ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses can be
# defined using space separator.
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 mybusinessips ip.of.master.server

# "bantime" is the number of seconds that a host is banned.
bantime  = 3600

# A host is banned if it has generated "maxretry" during the last "findtime"
# seconds.
findtime = 600
maxretry = 3

# "backend" specifies the backend used to get files modification.
# Available options are "pyinotify", "gamin", "polling" and "auto".
# This option can be overridden in each jail as well.
#
# pyinotify: requires pyinotify (a file alteration monitor) to be installed.
#            If pyinotify is not installed, Fail2ban will use auto.
# gamin:     requires Gamin (a file alteration monitor) to be installed.
#            If Gamin is not installed, Fail2ban will use auto.
# polling:   uses a polling algorithm which does not require external libraries.
# auto:      will try to use the following backends, in order:
#            pyinotify, gamin, polling.
backend = auto

# "usedns" specifies if jails should trust hostnames in logs,
#   warn when reverse DNS lookups are performed, or ignore all hostnames in logs
#
# yes:   if a hostname is encountered, a reverse DNS lookup will be performed.
# warn:  if a hostname is encountered, a reverse DNS lookup will be performed,
#        but it will be logged as a warning.
# no:    if a hostname is encountered, will not be used for banning,
#        but it will be logged as info.
usedns = warn

#
# Destination email address used solely for the interpolations in
# jail.{conf,local} configuration files.
destemail = supervision@mydomain.com

#
# Name of the sender for mta actions
sendername = Fail2Ban


#
# ACTIONS
#

# Default banning action (e.g. iptables, iptables-new,
# iptables-multiport, shorewall, etc) It is used to define
# action_* variables. Can be overridden globally or per
# section within jail.local file
banaction = iptables-multiport

# email action. Since 0.8.1 upstream fail2ban uses sendmail
# MTA for the mailing. Change mta configuration parameter to mail
# if you want to revert to conventional 'mail'.
mta = sendmail


[apache-shellshock]

enabled = true


[php-url-fopen]

enabled = true


[pam-generic]

enabled = true


[postfix-sasl]

# Overwrite param port since it is wrong into file jail.conf because it contains 'imap3' instead of 'imap' that does not exists
port    = smtp,465,submission,imap,imaps,pop3,pop3s
enabled = true


[sshd]

enabled = true


[xinetd-fail]

enabled = true


[apache-badbots]
# Ban hosts which agent identifies spammer robots crawling the web
# for email addresses. The mail outputs are buffered.
port     = http,https
logpath  = %(apache_access_log)s
bantime  = 172800
maxretry = 1
enabled  = true


[apache-noscript]

port     = http,https
logpath  = %(apache_error_log)s
maxretry = 6
enabled  = true


[apache-overflows]

port     = http,https
logpath  = %(apache_error_log)s
maxretry = 2
enabled  = true


[apache-nohome]

port     = http,https
logpath  = %(apache_error_log)s
maxretry = 2
enabled  = true


[apache-botsearch]

port     = http,https
logpath  = %(apache_error_log)s
maxretry = 2
enabled  = true


[mysqld-auth]

port     = 3306
logpath  = /var/log/mysql/error.log
#backend  = %(mysql_backend)s
enabled = true
bantime  = 7200      ; 2 hours
findtime = 3600      ; 1 hour
maxretry = 5

---------------

Then modify the values in this file for *mybusinessips* by your ip(s) separated by spaces as well as the parameter *destemail* by the supervision email of your company.


Then place the available filter files supplied with the project in *etc/fail2ban/filter.d* in the directory of the same name */etc/fail2ban/filter.d* by creating links:

[source, bash]
---------------
cd /etc/fail2ban/filter.d
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/email-dolibarr-ruleskoblacklist.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/email-dolibarr-ruleskoquota.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/email-dolibarr-rulesko.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/email-dolibarr-rulesall.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/email-dolibarr-rulesadmin.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/web-accesslog-limit403.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/web-dolibarr-rulespassforgotten.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/web-dolibarr-rulesbruteforce.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/web-dolibarr-ruleslimitpublic.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/web-dolibarr-rulesregisterinstance.conf
---------------

Then place sellyoursaas conf rules to enable that are supplied with the project in *etc/fail2ban/jail.d* inside the directory of the same name */etc/fail2ban/jail.d* by creating links:

*For all servers:*

[source, bash]
---------------
cd /etc/fail2ban/jail.d
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/email-dolibarr-ruleskoblacklist.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/email-dolibarr-ruleskoquota.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/email-dolibarr-rulesko.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/email-dolibarr-rulesall.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/email-dolibarr-rulesadmin.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/web-accesslog-limit403.conf
---------------

*Add also this for Master servers only:*

[source, bash]
---------------
cd /etc/fail2ban/jail.d
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/web-dolibarr-rulespassforgotten.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/web-dolibarr-rulesbruteforce.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/web-dolibarr-ruleslimitpublic.conf
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/web-dolibarr-rulesregisterinstance.conf
---------------


NOTE: Fail2ban won't start if any log mentioned in its conf does not exist, so you can create log files to be sure this way:

[source, bash]
---------------
grep logpath /etc/fail2ban/jail.local | cut -d= -f2 | grep '^ /'|sort|uniq|xargs touch
---------------



* Relaunch fail2ban and check errors into */var/log/fail2ban.log*

[source, bash]
---------------
/etc/init.d/fail2ban stop
/etc/init.d/fail2ban start
systemctl status fail2ban
fail2ban-client status
---------------


Note: If you need to have the existing log files re-parsed fully again, you must change a char at begin of the file to make the checksum for recovery point fails. If it fails, delete completely the file /var/lib/fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3

Note: To test a rule works, append a line into the log file and check the /var/log/fail2ban.log file. For example:
echo "2021-06-12 01:05:51 123.123.123.123 sellyoursaas rules ok ( <10 : 1 0 0 - /user/card.php?id=1 )" >> /var/log/phpsendmail.log

Note: To test a rule file on an existing log file:
fail2ban-regex /var/log/phpsendmail.log /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/email-dolibarr-rulesall.conf


=== Test spamassassin ===

The process *spamd* must be running. Start it manually if it is not the case the first time. You can start it manually using this command:

[source,bash]
---------------
/etc/init.d/spamassassin start
---------------

To test that spamassassin client is working, create a file */tmp/testspam* with content

[source,text]
---------------
    Subject: Test spam mail (GTUBE)
    Message-ID: <GTUBE1.1010101@example.net>
    Date: Wed, 23 Jul 2003 23:30:00 +0200
    From: Sender <sender@example.net>
    To: Recipient <recipient@example.net>
    Precedence: junk
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

    This is the GTUBE, the
	    Generic
	    Test for
	    Unsolicited
	    Bulk
	    Email

    If your spam filter supports it, the GTUBE provides a test by which you
    can verify that the filter is installed correctly and is detecting incoming
    spam. You can send yourself a test mail containing the following string of
    characters (in upper case and with no white spaces and line breaks):

    XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X

    You should send this test mail from an account outside of your network.
---------------

Then test with:

[source,bash]
---------------
spamc < /tmp/testspam
spamc -c < /tmp/testspam
echo $?
---------------

=== Test and setup of ClamAV

The processes *freshclam* and *clamd* should be running. If not, launch them manually (for example */etc/init.d/clamav-freshclam start* or */etc/init.d/clamav-daemon start* to launch them).

Test them: To test clamav tool, create a file */tmp/testvirus* with content

[source,bash]
---------------
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
---------------

And to test *clamav* command line and daemon:

[source,bash]
---------------
clamdscan /tmp/testvirus --fdpass
---------------

The output should have a line with the following content: *Infected files: 1*

Remove the apparmor profile for *usr.sbin.clamd*. It is required to be called from web process (otherwise error on "getattr").

[source,bash]
---------------
aa-disable usr.sbin.clamd
ls -alrt /etc/apparmor.d/disable
service apparmor reload
service apparmor status
service apache2 stop
service apache2 start
---------------

You should see into the status of apparmor a line saying that Profile *usr/sbin/clamd* is disabled.
Note: It seems we must also restart apache to have this effective inside apache.


=== Installation of Afick

* Install afick.pl tool from the debian package found on afick web site.

[source,bash]
---------------
wget -O afick.deb https://sourceforge.net/projects/afick/files/afick/3.7.0/afick_3.7.0-1ubuntu_all.deb/download
ou pour Ubuntu 18.04
wget -O afick.deb https://sourceforge.net/projects/afick/files/afick/3.7.0/afick_3.7.0-1ubuntu_all.deb/download
dpkg -i afick.deb
ou pour Ubuntu 22.04
wget -O afick.tgz https://sourceforge.net/projects/afick/files/afick/3.7.0/afick_3.7.0.tgz/download
tar -xvf afick-3.7.0.tgz; 
cd afick-3.7.0; perl Makefile.pl; make install; ln -fs /opt/afick/etc/afick.conf afick.conf; 
mv /etc/cron.daily/afick_cron.dpkg-new /etc/cron.daily/afick_cron 
---------------

* Comment the lines that exclude suffixes that we want to include in analysis in */etc/afick.conf* and keep uncommented only these ones (we only want to exclude log and backup):

[source,bash]
---------------
exclude_suffix := log LOG
exclude_suffix := tmp old bak
---------------

* Complete setup */etc/afick.conf* for section *macros* with:

[source,bash]
---------------
# used by cron job (afick_cron)
# define the mail adress to send cron job result
@@define MAILTO supervision@mysaasdomainname.com
# truncate the result sended by mail to the number of lines (avoid too long mails)
@@define LINES 1000
# REPORT = 1 to enable mail reports, =0 to disable report
@@define REPORT 1
# VERBOSE = 1 to have one mail by run, =0 to have a mail only if changes are detected
@@define VERBOSE 1
# define the nice value : from 0 to 19 (priority of the job)
@@define NICE 18
# = 1 to allow cron job, = 0 to suppress cron job
@@define BATCH 1
# if set to 0, keep all archives, else define the number of days to keep
# with the syntaxe nS , n for a number, S for the scale
# (d for day, w for week, m for month, y for year)
# ex : for 5 months : 5m
@@define ARCHIVE_RETENTION 6m
---------------

* Complete setup */etc/afick.conf* by adding at end:

Test that execution by crontab works correcly by running under root:

[source,bash]
---------------
/etc/cron.daily/afick_cron
---------------

It may takes several minutes to generate the database into */var/lib/afick* or */opt/afick/database/afick*.
Ignore if you have error when sending emails, sending emails is setup later.


=== Setup of cpulimit (optional)

* Launch a cpulimit daemon at startup for example with *cpulimit_daemon_launcher.sh*

[source,conf]
---------------
#!/bin/sh
#

See script *cpulimit_daemon* to put into */etc/init.d*.


=== Adding disk quotas per users (optionnal)

Note: Some global quotas can be set with the *ulimit* tool in */etc/security/limits.conf* (see next chapter on ulimit)


=== Setup of /etc/security/limits.conf (optional)

* Create a file */etc/security/limits.d/sellyoursaas.conf* (or edit file */etc/security/limits.conf* if ot does not work) for example to increase the max number of files open by a process and set the max filesize for users with ID >= 65535 (See "man limits.conf" for possible syntaxes)

[source,conf]
---------------
mysql           soft     nofile           4096
mysql           hard     nofile           32768

# Set max size of block written into a file (domain is UIDstart:UIDend with UIDend empty)
#65535:           soft     fsize            1000000

#65535:           hard     cpu              5000
---------------

Note: To get/see the current limits of OS and connected user:

[source,bash]
---------------
ulimit -a
---------------

Note: 
You can check that there is indeed the line *session required pam_limits.so* in the files */etc/pam.d/system-auth* or */etc/pam.d/password-auth* and/or */etc/pam.d/sudo* to ensure that you always set the thresholds set by the administrator each time a user logs into the system. If the limits defined in this file are not taken into account, the first instinct is to ensure that the pam_limits.so module is activated in the PAM configuration files. 
NOTE: On some distributions the PAM configuration files may differ. You can find the definition of the limits in the files */etc/pam.d/common-session* or */etc/pam.d/login*. But the principle remains the same: ensure that at each user connection the system resource thresholds are applied.



=== Setup of Postfix

Create a file */etc/postfix/generic* to add binding between email used to send email by the system that has a "from" empty and the email to use that is authorized to send emails officially (postfix will do the replacement).

[source,bash]
---------------

!!! IMPORTANT

Remember to change those lines in */etc/postfix/main.cf*:
 
[source,bash]
---------------
inet_interfaces = public.ip.returned.by_server_s_reverse_dns
inet_protocols = ipv4
---------------


This is a command to send an email from the server to test the Postfix installation:

[source,bash]
---------------
mail supervision@mysaasdomainname.com
---------------

Then check the email box and/or the file */var/log/mail.log* (if file /var/log/mail.log does not exists, check that */var/log/* has group write permission).

For information about the queue or the setup of Postfix:
---------------
postqueue -p
postsuper -r ALL
# Diff in master.cf
postconf -Mf
# Diff in main.cf
postconf -f
---------------

To get more log from Postfix, you must add "-v" into the file */etc/postfix/master.cf* after "smtpd", "local", "qmgr", ...
---------------
smtp      inet  n       -       y       -       -       smtpd -v
...
---------------


=== Configuring Postfix for a secured external SMTP authentication (optional)

If you need to use postix from an external (and thus authenticated) access

[source,bash]
---------------
sudo apt install sasl2-bin
vi /etc/default/saslauthd  pour mettre START=yes
---------------

Check that user postfix is in the *sasl* group. If not, add it:

[source,bash]
---------------
adduser postfix sasl
---------------

Add 'n' to */etc/postf*, to deactivate the smtpd chroot

[source,bash]
---------------
smtp      inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
---------------

Add a *smtpd.conf* file in */etc/postfix/sasl*

[source,bash]
---------------
saslauthd_path: /var/run/saslauthd/mux
pwcheck_method: saslauthd
mech_list: plain login
---------------

To use SMTPS, create a certificate:
 
[source,bash]
---------------
cd /etc/postfix
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout dsfc.key -out dsfc.crt
---------------

Complete */etc/postfix/main.cf*:

[source,bash]
---------------
# TLS parameters (only if you want TLS as SMTP server)
smtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/postfix/dfsc.crt
smtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/postfix/dfsc.key
#smtpd_tls_ask_ccert = yes

=== Setup of Mysql or Mariadb

==== Setup

On *Deployment servers*:

Edit the config file 
*/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service*  or  */lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service*
to put into section *[Service]* a value that is a limit number of files that is higher than the default value of *4096* (visible with *sudo systemctl show -p DefaultLimitNOFILE*) of systemd:

[source,bash]
---------------
LimitNOFILE=50000
Restart=no
#Restart=on-abort     # on-abort is also possible
#Restart=on-watchdog  # on-watchdog is also possible
---------------

This may avoid warning like "Could not increase number of max_open_files to more than".

Take the change into account with command:

[source,bash]
---------------
systemctl daemon-reload
---------------

Edit config file 
*/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf* (if mysql) 
or
*/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf* (if mariadb) 
to change:


[source,bash]
---------------
bind-address = 127.0.0.1
---------------

with 

[source,bash]
---------------
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
max_connections      = 500
max_user_connections = 25
# wait_timeout and interactive_timeout must be set both or none
wait_timeout         = 7200
interactive_timeout  = 7200
table_open_cache     = 10000
table_definition_cache = 8000
sort_buffer_size=2M
read_buffer_size=1M
join_buffer_size=2M
max_heap_table_size=32M
max_allowed_packet=100000000
# Mysql: max_execution_time = 120000 (milliseconds) or Mariadb: max_statement_time = 120 (seconds)
#max_execution_time = 120000

innodb_buffer_pool_size=1G
innodb_buffer_pool_instances=8
innodb_file_per_table=1
innodb_log_file_size=256M
innodb_log_buffer_size=32M


[mariadb]
log_warnings = 2
---------------

On a *Master* only server, change only the listened address :

[source,bash]
--------------
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
--------------

Note: This may be "listen = 0.0.0.0" instead of "bind-address = 0.0.0.0".

Restart the database server
[source,bash]
--------------
/etc/init.d/mysql restart
--------------


==== Set mysql root password

On *all servers*:

[source,bash]
---------------
SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('mysqlrootpassword');
-- For newer versions of mariadb, you must also do:
UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string = PASSWORD('mysqlrootpassword') WHERE User='root';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
---------------


==== Secure the root account

On *all servers*:

In order to disallow brute force cracking, if it is not already the case, put the user *root* of the database in authentication from the system root account only (using *auth_socket* or *unix_socket*):

For Mysql: The plugin is *auth_socket* and you have to install it manually. More info on: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/socket-pluggable-authentication.html

[source,sql]
---------------
INSTALL PLUGIN auth_socket SONAME 'auth_socket.so';
SELECT PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_STATUS FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS;
---------------

For MariaDb: The plugin is *unix_socket* and is set by default on Ubuntu OS.


To switch in mode authentification by password / by unix socket account :

For Mysql:

[source,sql]
---------------
# Identification by password
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '...';
# Identification by unix socket
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_socket;
---------------
You must stop/start database server to validate this change !

For MariaDb:

[source,sql]
---------------
# Identification by password
update mysql.user set plugin='' where user='root' and host='localhost';
# Identification by unix socket
update mysql.user set plugin='unix_socket' where user='root' and host='localhost';
---------------
You must stop/start database server to validate this change !


Note: To show specific parameters that are not the default values, you can launch:

[source,bash]
---------------
mysqld --print-defaults
---------------

To see the default value

[source,bash]
---------------
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'default_authentication_plugin';
---------------

Note: To delete active plugins, empty the mysql *plugin* table. See "Starting mysql without permissions" if this blocks the server from starting if necessary.



[[creer_un_compte_db_sellyoursaas]]
==== Create a user sellyoursaas to control databases of user instances

On the *Master* server and each *Deployment server*, grant access localy to the login *sellyoursaas*:

[source,sql]
---------------
CREATE USER 'sellyoursaas'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '...';

GRANT CREATE USER, GRANT OPTION, RELOAD, LOCK TABLES, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'sellyoursaas'@'localhost';

GRANT CREATE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, CREATE VIEW, DROP, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, ALTER, INDEX, REFERENCES, SHOW VIEW ON *.* TO 'sellyoursaas'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
---------------

Give permission, on the *Master server*, to the account *sellyoursaas* for each deployment server, on the database *dolibarr* (so the mysql client on deployment server can connect to the database):

[source,sql]
---------------
CREATE USER 'sellyoursaas'@'ip.server.deployment' IDENTIFIED BY '...';   (password is the one into /etc/sellyoursaas.conf of the deployment server)

GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE ON nom_de_base_dolibarr_master.* TO 'sellyoursaas'@'ip.server.deployment';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
---------------

--TODO Reduce permissions of this user sellyoursaas
This is used by:
* the batch *clean.sh* to SELECT contracts and to list dbn databases with SHOW DATABASES.
* the batch *batch_detect_evil_instances.php* to SELECT contracts
* the batch *batch_customers.php* to SELECT const, element_element, product, packages, CREATE actioncomm 

Note: If the user already exists, to set only the password:

[source,sql]
---------------
ALTER USER 'sellyoursaas'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '...';
or
SET PASSWORD FOR 'sellyoursaas'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('...');
or
update mysql.user SET authentication_string = PASSWORD('...') where user  = 'sellyoursaas' and host = 'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
---------------

==== Create a user to login, for remote administration (optional)

Give access rights on the database server to allow remote administration on all databases from your desktop:

[source,sql]
---------------
CREATE USER 'yourremotelogin'@'ip.poste.admin.distant' IDENTIFIED BY '...passwordforyourlogin...';
GRANT CREATE,CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES,CREATE VIEW,DROP,DELETE,INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE,ALTER,INDEX,LOCK TABLES,REFERENCES,SHOW VIEW ON *.* TO 'yourremotelogin'@'ip.poste.admin.distant';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
---------------

Note: If the user already exists, to set only the password:

[source,sql]
---------------
ALTER USER 'yourremotelogin'@'ip.poste.admin.distant' IDENTIFIED BY '...';
or
SET PASSWORD FOR 'yourremotelogin'@'ip.poste.admin.distant' = PASSWORD('...');
or
update mysql.user SET authentication_string = PASSWORD('...') where user  = 'yourremotelogin' and host =  'ip.poste.admin.distant';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
---------------


==== Create a user for supervision (optional)

If you use a supervision agent like *DataDog* to superize the database, create an accunt to access localy to the database (the password is the one defined into */etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/mysql.d/conf.yaml*):

[source,sql]
---------------
CREATE USER 'datadog'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '...passwordfordatadog...';
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
---------------


==== Setup mariadb cluster in mode master-slave (optional, abandonned)

On the server, activate the mode MASTER by adding the directives:

[source,bash]
---------------
server-id              = 1
log_bin                = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
expire_logs_days        = 10
max_binlog_size         = 100M
binlog_format           = MIXED
#binlog_do_db           = include_database_name
#binlog_ignore_db       = include_database_name
---------------

On slave, activate the setup for the SLAVE by adding the directives:

[source,bash]
---------------
server-id              = 100
replicate_ignore_db=mysql
replicate_ignore_db=information_schema
replicate_ignore_db=performance_schema
replicate_ignore_db=dolibarr
replicate_ignore_db=test
#replicate_do_db       = onlythedatabasestoreplicate
---------------

On master, create the replication account:

[source,sql]
---------------
GRANT SUPER, RELOAD, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repluser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'replpass';
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'repluser'
---------------

Reboot the servers.

Check that the *slave* can reach the master on a fixed IP, on port 3306.

On master:

[source,sql]
---------------
FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
SHOW MASTER STATUS;
---------------

-> Get login info


Dump the databases and transfer them on the slave.


On slave:

[source,sql]
---------------
START SLAVE;
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='myservername.mycomapny.com', MASTER_USER='repluser', MASTER_PASSWORD='xxxxxxxxx', MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysqld-bin.000004', MASTER_LOG_POS=643;
---------------


To check if the slave is waiting to replicate the master, if *Slave_IO_State* is set to *Waiting for master to send event*, if *Slave_IO_Running* and *Slave_SQL_Running* are set to YES, and see the last error :

[source,sql]
---------------
SHOW SLAVE STATUS;
---------------

Note: *Exec_Master_Log_Pos* should show the same value as SHOW MASTER STATUS on the server.
To force a slave to run the master requests on hold after a shutdown caused by an error:

[source,sql]
---------------
STOP SLAVE;
--SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER = 1;		-- Nb de requete en erreur à ignorer
START SLAVE;
---------------


In case there is a problem restarting the slave, set
innodb_force_recovery = 1 in */etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf*
But remove it after you solve the problem, to have the tables writable again.


(Voir https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/replicating-a-master-database-using-mariadb-10/)



=== Setup of AppArmor

On *deployment servers*:

Copy */bin/bash* into */bin/secureBash* (This shell file will be set as the shell for a new user by the deployment process)

[source,bash]
---------------
cp /bin/bash /bin/secureBash
---------------

On Ubuntu 20.04+, copy also */usr/bin/bash* into */usr/bin/secureBash*

[source,bash]
---------------
cp /bin/bash /bin/secureBash
---------------


Create an apparmor file */etc/apparmor.d/bin.secureBash* (or */etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.secureBash* with Ubuntu 20.04) with this content:

[source,bash]
---------------
include::repository_root/etc/apparmor.d/bin.secureBash[]
---------------


Create an apparmor file */etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.apache2* or */etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.apache2/* with this content:

[source,bash]
---------------
include::repository_root/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.apache2-deployment[]
---------------


Create an apparmor file */etc/apparmor.d/php-fpm7.4* with this content:

[source,bash]
---------------
include::repository_root/etc/apparmor.d/php-fpm7.4[]
---------------


* Note: To activate(reload)/desactivate a rule apparmor, use *aa-disable* or *aa-enforce* (or *aa-complain*)

To enable a profile:

[source,bash]
---------------
aa-status
aa-enforce bin.secureBash
aa-status
/etc/init.d/apparmor status
---------------

To disable a profile:

[source,bash]
---------------
aa-disable usr.sbin.mysqld
---------------

Sometimes, a reboot of server may be required to take into account any change on profile files.

All the disabled profiles are visible into */etc/apparmor.d/disable*

The log are visible into */var/log/kern.log* or */var/log/audit/audit.log*. You can use *aa-logprof* to know the log file used and convert its content into real rules into existing profiles.


* Note: From Ubuntu 20.04, to unload ALL apparmor profiles and reload them:

[source,bash]
---------------
aa-teardown; /etc/init.d/apparmor restart;
---------------

* Note: Before Ubuntu 20.04, to unload ALL apparmor profiles and reload them:

[source,bash]
---------------
/usr/sbin/service apparmor teardown; /etc/init.d/apparmor restart;
---------------


* Note: To list all confined/unconfined processus:

[source,bash]
---------------
ps fauxZ
---------------

* Once the apparmor is enabled for apache2, we must enable the module "apparmor" for apache, so Apache will switch to the profile *sellyoursaas-instances* 
when a instance is opened (and if the entry <IfModule mod_apparmor.c>AADefaultHatName sellyoursaas-instances</IfModule> is added into virtual host).
For this run:

[source,bash]
---------------
a2enmod apparmor
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart;
---------------


* To avoid to have apparmor relaunched after a manual stop, modify */lib/systemd/system/apparmor.service* to set *RemainAfterExit=no* (Still require ????)

[source,bash]
---------------
RemainAfterExit=no
---------------

Then
---------------
systemctl daemon-reload
---------------


=== Jailkit configuration (optional)

On **deployment servers**:

Jailkit is a set of utilities to limit user accounts to specific files using chroot() and or specific commands. Setting up a chroot shell, a shell limited to some specific command, or a daemon inside a chroot jail is a lot easier and can be automated using these utilities.

!! Important !!
Jailkit requires changing the access to /mnt/diskhome/home directory as it will not work with a symbolic link

* Remove the symbolic link /home/jail/home that points to /mnt/diskhome/home

[source,bash]
---------------
rm -f /home/jail/home
---------------

* Create the home directory which will be used for mounting /mnt/diskhome/home

[source,bash]
---------------
mkdir /home/jail/home
---------------

* Create the directory that will contain the chroot/jail of users

[source,bash]
---------------
mkdir /mnt/diskhome/chroot
mkdir /home/jail/chroot
---------------

* Add mounts from directories to /etc/fstab

[source,bash]
---------------
# /home/jail/home
/mnt/diskhome/home /home/jail/home bind defaults,bind 0 0
# /home/jail/chroot
/mnt/diskhome/chroot /home/jail/chroot bind defaults,bind 0 0
---------------

* Mount directories

[source,bash]
---------------
mount /home/jail/home
mount /home/jail/chroot
---------------

* Installing the Jailkit package

[source,bash]
---------------
sudo apt install jailkit
---------------

* Add this to the end of the config file /etc/jailkit/jk_init.ini

[source,bash]
---------------
[groups]
comment = Groups management
executables = /usr/bin/groups

[php]
comment = The PHP Interpreter and Libraries
executables = /usr/bin/php, /usr/bin/php7.4, /usr/bin/php7.3, /usr/bin/php7.2, /usr/bin/php5.6
directories = /usr/lib/php, /usr/share/php, /usr/share/php, /etc/php, /usr/share/php-geshi, /usr/share/zoneinfo
includesections = env

[env]
comment = environment variables
executables = /usr/bin/env

[mysqlclient]
comment = mysql client
executables = /usr/bin/mysql, /usr/bin/mysqldump
paths = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmysqlclient.so.21
regularfiles = /etc/mysql/my.cf, /etc/mysql/conf.d/, /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/
---------------

* Add this to the end of the config file /etc/jailkit/jk_chrootsh.ini

[source,bash]
---------------
[DEFAULT]
env = TERM, PATH
---------------

* Create the directory which will contain the chroot/jail model which will be used to create the templates

[source,bash]
---------------
mkdir /home/jail/chroot/template
---------------

* Initializing the chroot/jail with the commands you want to make available to users

[source,bash]
---------------
jk_init -c /etc/jailkit/jk_init.ini -j /home/jail/chroot/template extendedshell limitedshell groups sftp rsync editors git php mysqlclient
mkdir /home/jail/chroot/template/home
mkdir /home/jail/chroot/template/tmp
chmod 1777 /home/jail/chroot/template/tmp
---------------

In this example the commonjail.tgz template will be used to create the chroot/jail common /home/jail/chroot/commonjail (if it does not exist)

and the privatejail.tgz template will be used to create private chroot/jail (eg. /home/jail/chroot/osuxxxxx)

* Create your tgz which will be used to install the private chroot/jail and reinstall the common chroot/jail if necessary

[source,bash]
---------------
cd /home/jail/chroot
tar czf commonjail.tgz template
tar czf privatejail.tgz template
---------------

* Move your templates to the /sellyoursaas/scripts/templates directory accessible by your instances server

[source,bash]
---------------
mv commonjail.tgz privatejail.tgz /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/scripts/templates/
---------------

* Modify the /etc/sellyoursaas.conf file of your instances server

[source,bash]
---------------
# Options for Jailkit
chrootdir=/home/jail/chroot
privatejailtemplatename=privatejail
commonjailtemplatename=commonjail
---------------


* Enable the feature to be able to set if a deployment of a service will be done into jailkit or not.

For this, add this constant in your Dolibarr master backoffice in menu *Home - Setup - Other to activate Jailkit*

 SELLYOURSAAS_SSH_JAILKIT_ENABLED = 1


After this addition, a new field *"SSH access type"* is now available in the Service of the Application/Package to deploy:

image::config_jailkit_service.png[SSH access type]


and in contracts (instances):

image::config_jailkit_contrat.png[SSH access type]


Just set this field on the service of the Application to deploy to value *1* or *2* and new contracts will be deployed using an account in Jailkit.


=== Allow generation of PNG thumbs from PDFs

Remove the rule disabling the Ghostscript PDF format in ImageMagick. This allows ImageMagick and thus the PHP libraries to generate PNG thumbnails of a PDF file.

    vi /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml

Comment

    <!--  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" /> -->



=== Setup of DNS server for domains served by the Master server

==== On registrar side

In the registrar, update the DNS of the main domain *mysaasdomainname.com* with the following 2 *A* records:

    *admin.mysaasdomainname.com*         Domain of the admin tool, points to the master server's IP
    *myaccount.mysaasdomainname.com*     Domain of the user account tools, points to the master server's IP



=== Setup of DNS server for domains served by the Deployment servers

==== On registrar side

In the registrar, update the DNS of the main domain *mysaasdomainname.com* with *A* records 

    *withX.mysaasdomainname.com*          Type A		Subdomain of the actual user instances, points to the deployment server's IP
    *ns1withX.mysaasdomainname.com*       Type A		DNS server 1 of the user instances, points to the deployment server's IP
    *ns2withX.mysaasdomainname.com*       Type A		DNS server 2 of the user instances, points to the deployment server's IP

In the registrar, add also the DNS of the DNS servers of the main domain *withX.mysaasdomainname.com* with *NS* records 

    *withX.mysaasdomainname.com*       Type NS		DNS server 1 of the user instances, points to value *ns1withX.mysaasdomainname.com*
    *withX.mysaasdomainname.com*       Type NS		DNS server 2 of the user instances, points to value *ns2withX.mysaasdomainname.com*


*Optional (not available on most registrars)*:

You can also add record *GLUE record* on your register side for:

    *ns1withX.mysaasdomainname.com*
    *ns2withX.mysaasdomainname.com*

Note: X is the number of deployment server.

==== On deployment servers

We have to create the DNS files that will be used to store the DNS record of each customer *.withX.mysaasdomainname.com.
Those files will be completed after each new deployment.

Create a file */etc/bind/withX.mysaasdomainname.com.hosts* for the DNS *withX.mysaasdomainname.com* on the *Deployment server* (replace X):

[source,bash]
---------------
$ttl 1d
$ORIGIN withX.mysaasdomainname.com.
@               IN     SOA     ns1withX.mysaasdomainname.com. admin.mysaasdomainname.com. (
                2101011200       ; serial
                600              ; refresh = 10 minutes
                300              ; update retry = 5 minutes
                604800           ; expiry = 1 week
                660              ; negative ttl
                )
                NS              ns1withX.mysaasdomainname.com.
                NS              ns2withX.mysaasdomainname.com.
                IN      TXT     "v=spf1 mx ~all"

@               IN      A       ip.of.deployment.server		; ip of deployment server that hosts the deployed applications
*               IN      A       ip.of.deployment.server		; ip of deployment server that hosts the deployed applications

$ORIGIN withX.mysaasdomainname.com.

; entry for letsencrypt.
_acme-challenge IN	  TXT      "a-value-that-will-be-filled-later-for-lets-encrypt"


; this entry must always exists.
supervision A ip.of.deployment.server


; other sub-domain records
; here will be added entry like this one
; client1  A   ip.of.deployment.server


---------------


Add an entry into */etc/bind/named.conf.local* so the new file will be taken into account

[source,bash]
---------------
// mysaasdomainname.com
zone "withX.mysaasdomainname.com" {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/withX.mysaasdomainname.com.hosts";
        };
---------------


Create a directory */etc/bind/archives*

[source,bash]
---------------
mkdir /etc/bind/archives
---------------

Check that the default DNS resolver is indeed 127.0.0.1 with:

[source,bash]
---------------
nslookup supervision.withX.mysaasdomainname.com
---------------

If it is not 127.0.0.1 (but 127.0.0.53), deactivate *systemd-resolver* (see below) and create the file */etc/resolv.conf* manually.
Deactivate *systemd-resolver* that adds 127.0.0.53 as resolver and bypasses bind locally:

[source,bash]
---------------
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
rm /etc/resolv.conf; echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf
shutdown -Fr now
---------------


Do a test of DNS resolution using the local DNS server with

[source,bash]
---------------
host -a supervision.withX.mysaasdomainname.com 127.0.0.1
---------------

This must return the deployment server's IP.


Then double check with an external DNS, like Google's:

[source,bash]
---------------
nslookup supervision.withX.mysaasdomainname.com 8.8.8.8
---------------



=== Setup of PHP

==== Secure the directory of PHP sessions

Set permissions to *drwx-wx-wt* for php sessions directories */dev/shm/* and/or */var/lib/php/sessions*

[source,bash]
---------------
chmod -Rv 733 /dev/shm /var/lib/php/sessions
chmod +t /dev/shm /var/lib/php/sessions
---------------

==== Define size of upload and session options

Modify the file *`+/etc/php/*.*/*/php.ini+`* (the one for *apache*, the one for *cli* and for the *fpm*) to allow upload of bigger files:

[source,bash]
---------------
upload_max_filesize = 20M

post_max_size = 25M
max_input_vars = 4000

memory_limit = 256M

session.gc_maxlifetime = 3600

session.use_strict_mode = 1 
session.use_only_cookies = 1
session.cookie_httponly = 1
session.cookie_samesite = Lax

opcache.memory_consumption = 1024
opcache.max_accelerated_files = 100000
opcache.file_update_protection = 2
---------------

==== Disable some functions (optionnal)

Complete also the parameter *disable_functions* for the *apache* and *fpm* file (NOT for the *cli*) by adding:

[source,bash]
---------------
passthru,shell_exec,system,proc_open,popen
---------------

Warning: Do not add "exec".


==== Add a wrapper PHP for the mail() function

On *Master server*:

Create the sample files that will be used for antispam internal features of SellYourSaas.

[source,bash]
---------------
echo >> /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/spam/blacklistmail;
echo >> /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/spam/blacklistip;
echo >> /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/spam/blacklistfrom;
echo >> /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/spam/blacklistcontent;
---------------

On *Deployment servers*:

The PHP wrapper to send mail allows to intercept any mail sent via PHP before actually sending it (to do an antispam analysis and log it in a file that can be used by fail2ban)

For *PHP versions below 8.1*:

Create a symlink to the 2 tools used for preprocessing PHP

[source,bash]
---------------
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/phpsendmailprepend.php /usr/local/bin/
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/phpsendmail.php /usr/local/bin/
---------------

For *PHP versions greater than or equal to 8.1*:

Create a hard link to the 2 tools used for preprocessing PHP

[source,bash]
---------------
ln /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/phpsendmailprepend.php /usr/local/bin/
ln /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/phpsendmail.php /usr/local/bin/
---------------

Modify the file *php.ini* (the one for *apache* and the one for *cli*) with:

[source,bash]
---------------
; Automatically add files before PHP document.
; http://php.net/auto-prepend-file
auto_prepend_file = /usr/local/bin/phpsendmailprepend.php

; For Unix only.  You may supply arguments as well (default: "sendmail -t -i").
; http://php.net/sendmail-path
sendmail_path = /usr/local/bin/phpsendmail.php

; The path to a log file that will log all mail() calls. Log entries include
; the full path of the script, line number, To address and headers.
mail.log = /var/log/phpmail.log
---------------

Create the files *phpmail.log* and *phpsendmail.log*:

[source,bash]
---------------
echo >> /var/log/phpmail.log
echo >> /var/log/phpsendmail.log
chown syslog.adm /var/log/phpmail.log /var/log/phpsendmail.log
chmod a+rw /var/log/phpmail.log /var/log/phpsendmail.log
---------------

Create a directory for blacklist files used by *phpsendmail.php*

[source,bash]
---------------
mkdir -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam;
chown admin.www-data /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local;
chmod a+rwx /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local;
---------------

And copy them on local directory:

[source,bash]
---------------
cp -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/spam/blacklistmail /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam/blacklistmail;
cp -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/spam/blacklistip /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam/blacklistip;
cp -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/spam/blacklistfrom /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam/blacklistfrom;
cp -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/spam/blacklistcontent /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam/blacklistcontent;
chmod a+rwx /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam; chmod a+rw /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam/*;


mkdir /tmp/spam;
cp -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam/blacklistmail /tmp/spam/;
cp -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam/blacklistip /tmp/spam/;
cp -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam/blacklistfrom /tmp/spam/;
cp -p /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas_local/spam/blacklistcontent /tmp/spam/;
chmod a+rwx /tmp/spam; chmod a+rw /tmp/spam/*
---------------


=== Setup of logrotate

* Add a line if not already present into file */etc/logrotate.conf*

[source,bash]
---------------
# use the syslog group by default, since this is the owning group of /var/log.
su root syslog
---------------

* Modify the */etc/logrotate.d/apache2* to increase the delay of purge to 365 days.

[source,conf]
---------------
rotate 365
---------------

* Create a file */etc/logrotate.d/logrotate_admin_log*

[source,conf]
---------------
/home/*/logs/*log {
        su root root
        notifempty
        daily
        rotate 7
        compress
        sharedscripts
        postrotate
                if [ -f "`. /etc/apache2/envvars ; echo ${APACHE_PID_FILE:-/var/run/apache2.pid}`" ]; then
                        /etc/init.d/apache2 reload > /dev/null
                fi
        endscript
}
---------------


* Create a file */etc/logrotate.d/logrotate_sellyoursaas_log*

[source,conf]
---------------
/var/log/phpsendmail.log /var/log/phpmail.log {
        su root root        
        weekly
        rotate 4
        compress
        delaycompress
        missingok
        notifempty
        create 666 syslog adm
}

/var/log/remote_server.log {
        su root root
        weekly
        rotate 4
        compress
        delaycompress
        missingok
        notifempty
        create 600 root root
}

/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/*.log {
        su admin www-data
        daily
        rotate 7
        compress
        delaycompress
        missingok
        notifempty
        create 660 admin www-data
}
---------------


* To test rotation immediately:

[source,bash]
---------------
cd /etc/logrotate.d
logrotate -f logrotate_admin_log
logrotate -f logrotate_sellyoursaas_log
---------------


=== Setup of journalctl

Journals are stored into */var/log/journal/* (or into memory */run/log/journal/*)

* Edit the file */etc/systemd/journald.conf* to define the max size for systemd journals.

[source,conf]
---------------
...
SystemMaxUse=1G
# Define max size of each file (there is 1 file per user). Default is 1/8 of SystemMaxUse.
SystemMaxFileSize=5M
...
---------------

Take into account the change with:

[source,bash]
---------------
systemctl stop systemd-journald
systemctl start systemd-journald
---------------

To force clear of journal:

[source,bash]
---------------
journalctl --flush --rotate
journalctl --vacuum-size=1G
journalctl --vacuum-time=1d
---------------

To read journal:

[source,bash]
---------------
journalctl --disk-usage
journalctl --header
---------------


=== Disable or enable apport (optional, "on" recommended)

To enable:

[source,bash]
---------------
sudo systemctl enable apport.service
sudo systemctl start apport.service
sudo systemctl status apport.service
---------------

Note: To disable:

[source,bash]
---------------
sudo systemctl disable apport.service
sudo systemctl stop apport.service
sudo systemctl status apport.service
---------------

Note: Reports are into */var/crash*


=== Install certbot (for LetsEncrypt SSL certificates)

[source,bash]
---------------
sudo apt remove cerbot; sudo apt install snapd;
sudo snap install --classic certbot;
sudo ln -fs /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
---------------

And to list certbot cron job:

[source,bash]
---------------
systemctl list-timers
systemctl status snap.certbot.renew.timer
---------------


[[creation_certificat_ssl]]
[[ssl_certificate_creation]]
=== Create a wildcard SSL certificate for user instances

Into the following instructions, we will use X with value 1, 2, 3, ... (digit of pool of instance = digit of the deployment server).
This must be done on deployment servers only.

==== Obtain wildcard certificate files for *.withX.mysaasdomainname.com

You can use the solution 1 (not free and need annual manual update) or solution 2 (recommended as free and with no manual update required):

===== Solution 1: From a SSL provider

* Create the key *withX.mysaasdomainname.com.key* and csr *withX.mysaasdomainname.com.csr* files like so:

To generate the .key file:   
    
[source,bash]
---------------
cd /etc/apache2
openssl genrsa 2048 > withX.mysaasdomainname.com.key
chmod go-r withX.mysaasdomainname.com.key
---------------

To generate the .csr file:

[source,bash]
---------------
openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -keyout withX.mysaasdomainname.com.key -out withX.mysaasdomainname.com.csr
---------------

Choose:

	CN	*.withX.mysaasdomainname.com
	OU	IT
	O	The company name
	L	Paris
	S	IDF
	C	FR
	Email				Ne rien mettre !
	Challenge password		Ne rien mettre !

* Submit the *.csr* file to the SSL certificate provider.

* Get the SSL certificate files (the *.crt* file of the certificate and the intermediate certificate) and install them into */etc/apache2*)


===== Solution 2: From LetsEncrypt

* To create a SSL certficate *on the master* :

[source,bash]
---------------
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns -d "admin.<your_domain>"
---------------

* On the *deployment servers*, to create automatically renewable wildcard *.withX.mysaasdomainname.com certificates :

Run cerbot with the following command line (you can test it beforehand by adding the option *--dry-run*) :

[source,bash]
---------------
certbot certonly -n --manual-public-ip-logging-ok --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --manual-auth-hook /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/letsencrypt_authenticator.sh -d "*.with<X>.<your_domain>,with<X>.<your_domain>" -m <email_for_your_account_with_lets_encrypt> --deploy-hook "systemctl restart apache2" [--expand]
---------------

For example, you can use *supervision@mysaasdomainname.com* as the email for letsencrypt account.

This create certificates and also enable the automatic renewal of wildcard certificates so you do not need to renew manually every 90 days (systemd timer is run regularly, if the certificate is within 30 days of expiry, it is renewed automatically and the symbolic links in */etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>* are updated, so if you use those in your vhosts you have nothing more to do)

To read certificate .crt or .pem files, you can run:

[source,bash]
---------------
openssl x509 -in fullchain.pem -text
---------------

To read renewal scheduler:

[source,bash]
---------------
systemctl list-timers
systemctl status snap.certbot.renew.timer
---------------


* To renew a certificate on the *master*:

[source,bash]
---------------
certbot renew
or
certbot renew --force-renewal 
or 
certbot renew --cert-name admin.mysellyoursaasdomain.com --dry-run
---------------

* To renew a certificate on the *deployment servers*:

You can use the same command as used originally (with --dry-run option first if you want to check, replace value between <>)

[source,bash]
---------------
certbot certonly -n --manual-public-ip-logging-ok --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --manual-auth-hook /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas/scripts/letsencrypt_authenticator.sh -d "*.with<X>.<your_domain>,with<X>.<your_domain>" -m <email_for_your_account_with_lets_encrypt> --deploy-hook "systemctl restart apache2" --force-renewal
---------------

Note: To know if a certificate will correctly use the hook for the renewal, you can have a look into the file 
*/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/withX.mysaasdomainname.com.conf*

To check that a DNS update is ok for a challenge, you can use this URL: 
https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.withX.mysaasdomainname.com
or from command line: host -t txt _acme-challenge.withX.mysaasdomainname.com

* To remove completely a certificate, you can run

[source,bash]
---------------
find /etc/letsencrypt/ -name "*with<X>.<your_domain>*" -exec rm -fr {} \;
---------------


==== Install the certificates files

* Create a symbolic link with the generic name *withX.sellyoursaas.com.key*, *withX.sellyoursaas.com.crt* and *withX.sellyoursaas.com-intermediate.crt* to the generated certificate files:

For example, if your certificates files were generated with letsencrypt, you can do:

[source,bash]
---------------
cd /etc/apache2
ln -fs /etc/letsencrypt/live/withX.mysaasdomainname.com/privkey.pem with.sellyoursaas.com.key
ln -fs /etc/letsencrypt/live/withX.mysaasdomainname.com/cert.pem with.sellyoursaas.com.crt
ln -fs /etc/letsencrypt/live/withX.mysaasdomainname.com/chain.pem with.sellyoursaas.com-intermediate.crt
---------------

NOTE: This is the wildcard certificate that will be used for the customer instances. Custom certificates for instances will be saved into */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/crt*

* If the file */etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf* exists, rename it into */etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default-ssl.conf*

[source,bash]
---------------
mv /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default-ssl.conf
---------------

If not, create it as an empty file.

[source,bash]
---------------
touch /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default-ssl.conf
---------------


* Edit this file */etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default-ssl.conf* with this content:

[source,bash]
---------------
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
        <VirtualHost _default_:443>

---------------

So if a user is using an old URL with a delete virtual host, he will reach the default page */var/www/html/index.html*. 

* Edit the page */var/www/html/index.html* with the content

[source,bash]
---------------
<html>
<body>
<center>
<br>
<strong>Server (name_of_server_x)<br></strong>Sorry, there is currently no service available to this URL. May be this domain name was used in the past to host a customer instance that was permanently undeployed.<br>
You may try later or create a new instance from scratch from page <a href="https://www.mysaasdomainname.com">https://www.mysaasdomainname.com</a>.
<br>
</center>
</body>
</html>
---------------

* Enable the virtual host:

[source,bash]
---------------
a2ensite 000-default-ssl.conf
/etc/init.d/apache2 reload

==== Check that launching of cron is ok

Reprendre du fichier */etc/crontab*, les commandes pour tester le lancement de crontab journalière, hebdo et mensuelles et tester en lançant en manuel. Par exemple par:

[source,bash]
---------------
cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily
---------------



== Installation of Dolibarr framework

We need to install the program files of Dolibarr ERP CRM as we use it for a lot of utiliy tools.

On all servers (*Master and Deployment*):

* Create a symbolic link called *sellyoursaas* into */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom* to point to */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas* :

[source,bash]
---------------
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_sellyoursaas /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas
---------------

* Create a symbolic link called *source* into directory *myaccount* that point to */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs* :

[source,bash]
---------------
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/myaccount/source
---------------

* Create a symbolic link called *main.inc.php* into directory *myaccount* that point to */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/main.inc.php* :

[source,bash]
---------------
ln -fs /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/main.inc.php /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/myaccount
---------------


On *Master server*:

* Enable the virtual host for admin and myaccount (we have created the virtual host file before):

[source,ini]
---------------
a2ensite admin.mysaasdomainname.com
a2ensite myaccount.mysaasdomainname.com
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
---------------

* Generate the virtual host and the SSL certificate for this 2 sites using letsencrypt:

[source,ini]
---------------
certbot
---------------

* Call the URL to install Dolibarr. Warning: Choose, during the installation wizard, the name of the document directory as */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents* rather than */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/documents*

* If you configure the sending of emails from the Dolibarr backoffice via an SMTP relay like Google or SendGrid, remember to update the IPs (v4 and v6) authorized by the relay on the console of the SMTP relay service with the IP of the Master server.

* Activate the "Cron / Scheduled Jobs" module and set the cron security key to the same value as what was set in the parameter of the call to *cron_run_jobs.php* in the cron of user *admin*.


On *Deployment servers*:

* Create a file */home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/conf/conf.php*:

[source,ini]
---------------
sudo vi /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/conf/conf.php
---------------

and add the following content:

[source,ini]
---------------
<?php
$dolibarr_main_document_root='/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs';
$dolibarr_main_data_root='/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents';

$dolibarr_main_instance_unique_id='...';	// Use the same ID than the master server.
---------------


=== Installation of Geoip2

* Install the free database file of Maxmind.

mkdir /home/admin/tools/maxmind/ -p

Copy the file GeoLite2-Country.mmdb you can get from website maxmind.com

(or wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/geolite2-country@1.0.2/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb.gz)

chmod -R o-w /home/admin/tools/maxmind

On the Dolibarr *master server*, activate and setup the module GeoIP of Dolibarr to use this database file.


== Installation or update of plugin SellYourSaas

For a first installation, you must make the initial setup of plugin. 
If you just added a new deployment server, you must just edit the setup of the module to declare the new server.


On the *Master*:

Connect to Dolibarr's master server's user interface (https://admin.mysaasdomainname.com):

* Activate the module *SellYourSaas* and *Vendor*

* Create a *Generic Dolibarr user account* called "Service account for Saas anonymous" that will be used to access Dolibarr data and functions when a customer is using the public customer interface. Give this user the permissions below and only the permission below:

** Agenda Module 
*** Read actions

* Create a *Product tag* called "SaaS products"

* Create a *Third-party tag* called "SaaS customers" and "Saas resellers"

* Setup the module *SellYoursSaas*, at least the mandatory fields:

** Name of Saas service
** Name of main domain
** Liste des sous-domaines pour déploiement de nouvelles instances: You must enter here the domain name and ip of deployment server that are open for deployment.
** List of ip
** Main email 
...

* Create a *Package* to configure the applications to be deployed (files, config, database dump...)

See "Setup of Packages" chapter below.

* Create a *Service* with type *Application* to define the pricing of a subscription and choose the application *Package*.

See "Setup of Services" for a description of the fields.

* Create *Metric* type *Services* if you want

See "Setup of Services" for a description of the fields.

* Create *Options* type *Services* if you want

See "Services Configuration" for a description of the fields.


Note: The *Options* and *Metrics* type services must be linked to an *Application* type service in The Virtual Products tab. 

Note: The URL to deploy *Applications* type packages can be viewed in the *SellYourSaas - Deployment URL* menu


* Go to the configuration of the *Scheduled jobs* module and retrieve the instruction to add in the cron of the user *admin*. Check if not add this instruction so that the Sell-Your-Saas batches can run.

== Exploitation - Supervision

=== Test an installation

This is some steps to do to test an installation:

- You can run the script desktop_install_check.sh. It will run an ansible script to check your instance (and may fix some trouble). This
script is regularly completed but still check only few part of your installation only.

- If the deployed application is Dolibarr check the page Home - System info - security info.

- If the deployed application is Dolibarr check the page Home - System info - performances.

- If the deployed application is Dolibarr try to upload a file from menu Home - Setup - Security - Upload file.

- If the deployed application is Dolibarr try to make a backup from the internal backup tool.

- If the deployed application is Dolibarr, you can check a call of page https://myinstances/public/test/test_exec.php

- Try to send an email from a deployed application with no particular setup.

- Try to send an email from a deployed application using a setup of a SMTP server.


=== Backup / Restore

==== Backup system

A backup of the server+bases can be done with a VM snapshot.
It is also possible to snapshot only extra disks.

See chapter <<Cloning_a_server_instance_for_an_extra_production_server_or_a_dev_server>>

==== Restoration system

From OVH's "Snapshots" interface, you can restore a VM image on a server or a disk image on a disk, provided the target has at least the same amount of storage.

See chapter <<Cloning_a_server_instance_for_an_extra_production_server_or_a_dev_server>>


==== Backup files and database

===== Local backup

- The configuration of the server and the system database is done locally via the cron task of *root* :

*/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/backup_mysql_system.sh confirm* 

See <<installing_cron_tasks>>. This will write backup files into */home/admin/backup/conf* and */home/admin/backup/mysql*

- Paying user instances are backed up locally by the cron task of *admin* :

*/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/batch_customers.php backup*

See <<installing_cron_tasks>>. This will write backup files into */mnt/diskbackup/backup/osu*


===== Remote backup

- An external backup must be done to another server by a cron task of *root* :

*/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/backup_backups.sh confirm >/home/admin/logs/backup_backups.log 2>&1*

See <<installing_cron_tasks>>. This will copy local files from */mnt/diskbackup/backup* to */mnt/diskbackup/backup_sourceServer* (to another server in another datacenter). 

The script will read the file */etc/sellyoursaas.conf* to find the list of the name of backup servers where to push the backup to.


- For a remote backup as AWS:

[source,bash]
---------------
pip install awscli --upgrade --user

    TODO...
---------------

=== Moving an instance withX into withY

*If the new instance withY exists:*

Then go on the page of contract/instance X in the backoffice, tab "Backups" and use the command lines into 
section "Duplicate an instance into another instance (already existing instance)".


*If the new instance withY does not exists yet:*

Then go on the file of instance X in the backoffice, tab "Backups" and use the command lines into 
section "Move an instance into another server (non existing target instance)".

The option "confirm" will move the instance and close the old one.
The option "confirmredirect" will move the instance and the old one will be flagged as a "redirect to the new one"
so the old URL will still works (temporarily until the old instance is closed)


=== Update images of application to deploy

- A cron script on the *Master* does the git pull to update the images of the packages to deploy.
*/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/git_update_sources.sh /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas/git*


=== Update Sell-Your-Saas statistics

- A cron script on *Master* calulates statistics: 
*/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/batch_customers.php updatestatsonly*


=== Increase size of disk

* Take a snapshot of the disk to resize for backup. Create a new disk from this snapshot and attach it to another server (see chapter <<adding_a_disk>>) to ensure it is readable and you have backup files handy.

* Unmount the filesystem:

[source,bash]
---------------
umount /mnt/disk/
---------------

Note: To see open files on a disk if umount fails:

[source,bash]
---------------
lsof | grep "/mnt/disk"
---------------

* Detach the disk from the server. Ensure its name does not contain white space or special characters. Change the disk size from the Public Cloud manager and re-attach it to the server.

* Increase the partition size by running:

[source,bash]
---------------
fdisk -l
parted /dev/vdX    (X=a, b, etc!!! WITHOUT the digit, we want the full disk)
print all
resizepart 
Y		  (the num of the part)
999GB    (Don't input the default value but the max value in column "End" of the disk that was shown by "print all")
q
---------------

* Remount the disk for acknowledgement and resizing without erasing data.

[source,bash]
---------------
mount /mnt/disk/
resize2fs /dev/vdX9
---------------


[[Cloning_a_server_instance_for_an_extra_production_server_or_a_dev_server]]
=== Clone or duplicate a server instance into another server

The following explains the operations to clone a deployment server into another new deployment server.

==== Create the new server

- Create a snapshot of the *Deployment server* to be cloned (for security purposes).

- Create a new server from that snapshot:

*With OVH*:

Choose name of server, for example:  withX.mysaasdomainname.com

Choose the snapshot or image to use and copy the content of file */scripts/post_inst_script.sh* into area *post installation script*.

Once the server is created, double check it does have an associated IP visible in OVH dashboard. If not go to the horizon console on the server, detach the network interfaces, then add a new network interface. Leave the field "Fixed IP" empty so it is set by OVH. Reboot the server.

If you can't connect to server, it is possible that you have to configure */etc/network/interfaces* to get your IPv4 via DHCP. To do so :
Connect to the console of server from OVH dashboard. Execute *ip link show* to get the MAC address. Check the file */etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml* to get the right MAC address.
Correct and reboot if needed. 

Then correct IPv6 setup into file */etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml*.

[source,bash]
---------------
netplan try
netplan apply
---------------

*With ScaleWay*:

TODO


==== Disable cron

- Once the server is ready: connect to it to deactivate the crons tasks (coming from the cloned server). You can do this by disabling the cron process itself with :

[source,bash]
---------------
systemctl stop cron
systemctl disable cron
systemctl status cron
---------------

- Edit the crons for *root* and *admin* 

---------------
crontab -e
---------------


==== Set reverse IP name and add a DNS name for IP

* Check the */etc/hostname* file to have short name of server. The file should have as sole content:

[source, bash]
---------------
nameofserver
---------------


Edit the file */etc/hosts* to get the entry of the new server:

[source, bash]
---------------
main.ip.of.server nameofserver.mysaasdomainname.com
127.0.0.1  nameofserver
---------------

* In your DNS provider dashboard, add the entry of the new server *mynewserverX.mydomain.com* in the DNS of *mydomain.com*, with the IPv4 (A record) and IPv6 (AAAA record) given by your server provider during server creation.

* Once entries are created, you can set the reverse (PTR record) name of the IP v4 and v6 for the new server on your Server provider dashboard to the new server's name : *mynewserverX.mydomain.com*


==== Create data disks

- Edit */etc/fstab* to remove the entry mounting data disks (that may link to the disk of old instance).

- Create a snapshot of the source data disk (if you have a source to reuse).
  or
- Create a new OVH data disk (from the snapshot or from scratch) and attach it to the server. After association, disk must be visible with :

	fdisk -l

- If it is an empty disk, format the new data disk. To do so, see the chapter <<adding_a_disk>>.
  If the disk was formatted before, see the chapter <<adding_a_disk>> to only mount it and add in */etc/fstab*.

- Add a file at the root of the disk to identify the volume (for instance: DATA_MYSERVERNAME, BACKUP_MYSERVERNAME, ...). 

---------------
touch /mnt/diskhome/DATA_MYDEPLOYMENTSERVERX
---------------

- Add a new permision for NFS access for the new server on *Master server*

[source,bash]
---------------
vi /etc/exports
---------------

to add a line that looks like:

[source,bash]
---------------
/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas <deployment.server.IP>(ro,no_root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
---------------

[source,bash]
---------------
exportfs -v -a			#(to validate new entries to add)
exportfs
systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
---------------

- Add an entry to have the NFS mounted after a reboot, in */etc/fstab* on the new deployment server .

[source,bash]
---------------
<master.server.IP>:/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas  nfs  defaults 0 0
---------------

- Allow access between the new *Deployment server* and the *Master server* in the firewall.

*If using iptables*

On the *Master server*:

[source,bash]
---------------
${IPTABLES} -t filter -A INPUT -p tcp -s <deployment.server.IP> --dport nfs -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
${IPTABLES} -t filter -A INPUT -p udp -s <deployment.server.IP> --dport nfs -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
${IPTABLES} -t filter -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d <deployment.server.IP> --sport nfs -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
${IPTABLES} -t filter -A OUTPUT -p udp -d <deployment.server.IP> --sport nfs -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
---------------
s
And on the *deployment servers*

If we have two IPs get them like so:

[source,bash]
---------------
IP_SERVER=`ifconfig | sed -En 's/127.0.0.1//;s/.*inet (addr:)?(([0-9]*\.){3}[0-9]*).*/\2/p' | head -n 1`
IP_SERVER_V6=`ifconfig | grep -i global | sed -En 's/127.0.0.1//;s/.*inet6 (addr:)?\s?([^\s]+)/\2/p' | cut -d' ' -f1 | cut -d'/' -f1 `
IP_SERVER2=`ifconfig | sed -En 's/127.0.0.1//;s/.*inet (addr:)?(([0-9]*\.){3}[0-9]*).*/\2/p' | sed '2 ! d'`
---------------

You must add

[source,bash]
---------------
IP_SELLYOURSAAS_ADMIN=<master.server.IP>

${IPTABLES} -t filter -A OUTPUT -s $IP_SERVER -d $IP_SELLYOURSAAS_ADMIN -j ACCEPT
${IPTABLES} -t filter -A INPUT -s $IP_SELLYOURSAAS_ADMIN -d $IP_SERVER -j ACCEPT
if [ "x$IP_SERVER2" != "x" ]
then
        ${IPTABLES} -t filter -A OUTPUT -s $IP_SERVER2 -d $IP_SELLYOURSAAS_ADMIN -j ACCEPT
        ${IPTABLES} -t filter -A INPUT -s $IP_SELLYOURSAAS_ADMIN -d $IP_SERVER2 -j ACCEPT
fi
---------------

*If using ufw*

Nothing to do.


==== Other changes to make

- Modify the Postfix configuration files below (you can also deactivate Postfix completely or simply send emails to a dummy SMTP server for development purposes)
  
  */etc/postfix/main.cf*
  */etc/postfix/mydestination*
  */etc/postfix/generic*
  */etc/mailname*

- Edit */var/www/html/index.html* if it exists to set the new server name.

- Check */etc/network/interfaces* and */etc/network/interfaces.d/* to set the right values for vrack public, virtual and internal IPs if OVH vrack is used

- Modify Apache virtualhosts in */etc/apache2/sites-enabled* to set the new IP and name.

- Declare the IP for mail sending:
    - If a remote SMTP server is used (Google, SendGrid, ...) and you enabled restrictions on IPs, authorize the new server's IP for this new server.
    - Add the new server IPs in the DNS SPF entries (SPF may requires one entry for the domain *@mydomain.com* but also one for each subdomains).

- Create a user *sellyoursaas* on the *master* server's DB, with permissions to access from the deployment server.

[source,sql]
---------------
CREATE USER 'sellyoursaas'@'ip.server.deployment' IDENTIFIED BY '...';   (le mot de passe est celui dans /etc/sellyoursaas.conf du serveur de déploiement)

GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE ON nom_de_base_dolibarr_master.* TO 'sellyoursaas'@'ip.server.deployment';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
---------------

- Modify */etc/sellyoursaas.conf* with the new IP, subdomain of the new pool and master database access information.

- Remove files in :

  */etc/apache2/sellyoursaas-online*
  */etc/apache2/sellyoursaas-offline*
  */etc/apache2/sellyoursaas-available*

- And files matching:
  
  */var/spool/mail/osu**
  */var/spool/cron/crontabs/osu**

- Erase osu* lines from those files 

  */etc/passwd*
  */etc/shadow*
  */etc/group*
  
- Remove the folders */mnt/diskhome/home/osu...* and */mnt/diskhome/backup/osu...*

- Remove the folders 

  /etc/letsencrypt/archive/with*
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/with*
  /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/with*

- If datadog is used (optionnal), fix the file */etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/http_check.d/conf.yaml* to use the new name of server.
  
- Destroy the database

    - of *dolibarr* master if source was the *Master* server.
    - of user instances if source was a deployment server. This can be done by doing:
  
[source,bash]
---------------
mysql -uroot -e "show databases" | grep dbn | gawk '{print "drop database `" $1 "`;select sleep(0.1);"}' > /tmp/dbntodelete.sql
mysql -uroot < /tmp/dbntodelete.sql
---------------
  
- Rename the DNS file */etc/bind/withX.mydomain.com.hosts* into */etc/bind/with(X+1).mydomain.com.hosts* and edit it to use the new prefix.

- Modify */etc/bind/named.conf.local* to use the new name.

- Add A records *ns1withX*, *ns2withX* pointing to the new deployement server IP to the domain *mydomain.com*

- Add NS record pointing for *withX* to the domain *mydomain.com*, pointing to *ns1withX.mydomain.com*.

- Restart the server.

- Check that *http://ipnouveauserverdeployment:8080/index.php/test* returns "404 Not Found" when requested from the *master*.

- Double check that folders existent with the right permissions or force them:

[source,bash]
---------------
mkdir /mnt/diskbackup/backup /mnt/diskbackup/archives-test /mnt/diskbackup/archives-paid;
chown admin.root /mnt/diskbackup/backup /mnt/diskbackup/archives-test /mnt/diskbackup/archives-paid;
---------------

- Acquire or generate the SSL certificates of the new subdomain *withX.mydomain.com*, upload them to the server and create the symbolic links. (see <<ssl_certificate_creation>>).


In addition, if other applications were active on the cloned server:

* For Prestashop sites, if the new server has a new url:
** go into database to set correct url into table *ps_configuration* (var PS_SHOP_DOMAIN, PS_SHOP_DOMAIN_SSL, CANONICAL_URL) and *ps_shop_url*
** remove all cache files: cd cache; rm -fr **; cd themes/xxx/cache; rm -fr **;
** check also that templates do not contain hard coded redirect like "<a href="http{if Tools::usingSecureMode()}s{/if}://dev.dolistore.com" title="{$shop_name|escape:'html':'UTF-8'}">
** change payment modules from Live to Test if the copy is for development

* For Mediawiki sites, if VM has a new url, go into database to set correct url into file *LocalSettings.php*


=== Upgrade OS

To update Ubuntu to a higher LTS version on a SellYourSaas server:

[source,sql]
---------------
apt dist-upgrade

# if you move from 16.04 to 18.04, you must also run
apt install php-mysql
a2enmod php7.2
apt remove php-fpm php7-fpm

# if you move from 18.04 to 20.04, you must also run
apt install php-mysql
a2enmod php7.4
apt remove php-fpm php7-fpm
---------------


[[check_database_used]]
=== Follow space used by database

The following request gives the "real" space taken by databases (without the "padding")

[source,sql]
---------------
show variables like 'innodb_stats_on_metadata';
SET GLOBAL innodb_stats_on_metadata=0;
SELECT table_schema "DB Name", ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 1) "DB Size in MB",
SUM(data_length) "Data", SUM(index_length) "Index"  FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema LIKE 'dbna%'
GROUP BY table_schema;
---------------

And per table

[source,sql]
---------------
show variables like 'innodb_stats_on_metadata';
SET GLOBAL innodb_stats_on_metadata=0;
SELECT table_schema "DB Name", table_name, ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 1) "DB Size in MB",
SUM(data_length) "Data", SUM(index_length) "Index"  FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema LIKE 'dbna%'
GROUP BY table_schema, table_name;
---------------

or old request:

[source,sql]
---------------
SELECT IFNULL(B.engine,'Total') "Storage Engine",
CONCAT(LPAD(REPLACE(FORMAT(B.DSize/POWER(1024,pw),3),',',''),17,' '),' ',
SUBSTR(' KMGTP',pw+1,1),'B') "Data Size", CONCAT(LPAD(REPLACE(

FROM (SELECT engine,SUM(data_length) DSize,SUM(index_length) ISize,
SUM(data_length+index_length) TSize FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('mysql','information_schema','performance_schema')
AND engine IS NOT NULL GROUP BY engine WITH ROLLUP) B,
(SELECT 3 pw) A ORDER BY TSize;
---------------


=== Read or find deadlocks on the database

[source,bash]
---------------
echo "show engine innodb status" | mysql  | sed 's/\\n/\n/g' > /tmp/innodbstatus
---------------

[source,sql]
---------------
kill query ...
kill ...
---------------



=== Follow files modified (using Afick)

To update the list of modified files since afick run last:

[source,bash]
---------------
afick.pl -k
---------------

See the history of changes:

[source,bash]
---------------
vi /var/lib/afick/history
---------------

See details of changes for a specific day:

[source,bash]
---------------
vi /var/lib/afick/archive/afick.YYYMMDD*
---------------

Check out *afick.pl* documentation for more options.



=== Restore a lost config file of a package

Launch this command to find the package that provide the file:

[source,bash]
---------------
dpkg -S '/path/to/file'
---------------

Then launch a command to restore file:

[source,bash]
---------------
sudo apt install --reinstall -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" <package-name>
or
sudo apt install --reinstall -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confask,confnew,confmiss" <package-name>
---------------

Example when missing /etc/apparmor/severity.db, run sudo apt install --reinstall -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" apparmor-utils


=== Using OpenStack to manage server images

- Install OPenStack utilities

[source,bash]
---------------
apt install python3-openstackclient python3-novaclient python3-glanceclient -y
---------------

- Create an API account for OpenStack Horizon and get the file RC OpenStack File v3. Launch it.

[source,bash]
---------------
source openrc.sh
---------------

- OpenStack commands are now available.

To get an instance's image:

[source,bash]
---------------
nova list
nova image-create aaa115b3-83df-4375-b2ee-19339041dcfa image-myfile-server1
glance image-list   
   ou   openstack image list
glance image-download --file image-myfile-server1.qcow2 aaab785d-8a34-40f5-bdcd-0a3c3c350c5a   
   ou   openstack image save --file image-myfile-server1.qcow2 aaab785d-8a34-40f5-bdcd-0a3c3c350c5a
---------------

To push an instance's image on a project:

[source,bash]
---------------
source openrctarget.sh
export OS_REGION_NAME=SBG1
glance image-create --name nom_image_snaphot_new_server --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --file mon_fichier_snap_serveur1.qcow2
---------------

To get a volume image, you need to create from the detached volume (can't use a snapshot)

[source,bash]
---------------
openstack volume list
...Then detach the volume from its server...
openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --volume 673b0ad9-1fca-485c-ae2b-8ee271b71dc7 nom_image_snaphot_new_volume

...wait until the copy is finished...

openstack image list

openstack image save --file nom_image_snaphot_new_volume.qcow2 8625f87e-8248-4e62-a0ce-a89c7bd1a9be
---------------

To push an image on a project:

[source,bash]
---------------

---------------

- To recreate a server from an image

See chapter <<Cloning_a_server_instance_for_an_extra_production_server_or_a_dev_server>>


=== Booting a server in rescue mode

Use the Cloud service interface to switch to rescue mode. The server will be rebooted and a link to log in will be provided.

Find attached disks and mount the system disk.

[source,bash]
---------------
lsblk
mount /dev/sdXY /mnt    #(with X=a, b, c, etc and Y the partition number, 1, 2, 3, etc)
---------------

The disk is then accessible and writable in /mnt


=== Move the database (var/lib/mysql into /mnt/diskhome/mysql/)

From the MySQL prompt, select the data directory:

mysql -uroot

select @@datadir;

+-----------------+
| @@datadir       |
+-----------------+
| /var/lib/mysql/ |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

This output confirms that MySQL is configured to use the default data directory, /var/lib/mysql/, so that’s the directory we need to move. Once you’ve confirmed this, type exit and press “ENTER” to leave the monitor:

exit

To ensure the integrity of the data, we’ll shut down MySQL before we actually make changes to the data directory:

sudo systemctl stop mysqld

systemctl doesn’t display the outcome of all service management commands, so if you want to be sure you’ve succeeded, use the following command:

sudo systemctl status mysqld

You can be sure it’s shut down if the final line of the output tells you the server is stopped like in this example:

...
Jul 18 11:24:20 ubuntu-512mb-nyc1-01 systemd[1]: Stopped MySQL Community Server.

Now that the server is shut down, we’ll copy the existing database directory to the new location with rsync. Using the -a flag preserves the permissions and other directory properties, while-v provides verbose output so you can follow the progress.

Note: Be sure there is no trailing slash on the directory, which may be added if you use tab completion. When there’s a trailing slash, rsync will dump the contents of the directory into the mount point instead of transferring it into a containing mysql directory:

sudo rsync -av /var/lib/mysql /mnt/volume-nyc1-01
Once the rsync is complete, rename the current folder with a .bak extension and keep it until we’ve confirmed the move was successful. By re-naming it, we’ll avoid confusion that could arise from files in both the new and the old location:

sudo mv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/mysql.bak
Now we’re ready to turn our attention to configuration.

Step 2 — Pointing to the New Data Location
MySQL has several ways to override configuration values. By default, the datadir is set to /var/lib/mysql in the /etc/my.cnf file. Edit this file to reflect the new data directory:

sudo vi /etc/my.cnf
Find the line in the [mysqld] block that begins with datadir=, which is separated from the block heading with several comments. Change the path which follows to reflect the new location. In addition, since the socket was previously man mlocated in the data directory, we’ll need to update it to the new location:

[source,bash]
---------------
vi /etc/my.cnf
[mysqld]
datadir=/mnt/volume-nyc1-01/mysql
socket=/mnt/volume-nyc1-01/mysql/mysql.sock
---------------

After updating the existing lines, we’ll need to add configuration for the mysql client. Insert the following settings at the bottom of the file so it won’t split up directives in the [mysqld] block:

[source,bash]
---------------
vi /etc/my.cnf
[client]
port=3306
socket=/mnt/volume-nyc1-01/mysql/mysql.sock
---------------
When you’re done, hit ESCAPE, then type :wq! to save and exit the file.

Step 3 — Restarting MySQL
Now that we’ve updated the configuration to use the new location, we’re ready to start MySQL and verify our work.

sudo systemctl start mysqld
sudo systemctl status mysqld
To make sure that the new data directory is indeed in use, start the MySQL monitor.

mysql -u root -p
Look at the value for the data directory again:

[source,sql]
----------------
select @@datadir;
Output
+----------------------------+
| @@datadir                  |
+----------------------------+
| /mnt/volume-nyc1-01/mysql/ |
+----------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
----------------

Now that you’ve restarted MySQL and confirmed that it’s using the new location, take the opportunity to ensure that your database is fully functional. Once you’ve verified the integrity of any existing data, you can remove the backup data directory with sudo rm -Rf /var/lib/mysql.bak.


!!!!! On Ubuntu 18.04
Add */mnt/diskhome/mysql* in the apparmor profiles containing */var/lib/mysql* (file */etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld*)

[source,bash]
---------------
# ADD For SellYourSaas. It allows also to move mysql dir into /mnt/diskhome if required. 
  /proc/*/status r,
  /sys/devices/system/node/ r,
  /sys/devices/system/node/node*/meminfo r,
  /sys/devices/system/node/*/* r,
  /sys/devices/system/node/* r,
  /mnt/diskhome/mysql/ r,
  /mnt/diskhome/mysql/** rwk,
---------------


Reload the apparmor profile

[source,bash]
---------------
aa-enforce usr.sbin.mysqld
---------------



[[special_start_mysql_mariadb]]
=== Special start of mysql or mariadb

* Without permission (to bypass root password for example):

[source,bash]
---------------
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld; 
sudo chown mysql /var/run/mysqld; 
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
---------------

* With a mode different for recovery, modify */etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.conf* to set 1, 2, 3, 4

[source,bash]
---------------
### RECOVERY
innodb_force_recovery=1
---------------

At 3 or more, there is a risk of data loss.


NOTE: If launching takes a long time, to follow what's happening, do:

[source,bash]
---------------
lsof -p PID_of_ps_grep_mysqld 
---------------
to see files and DBs treated in relog. They are open either by date of the inodes or by alphabetical order in the dbn folder... (do it several times to determine which)


=== Check that batch of user instances are executed.

All cron files are stored into */var/spool/cron/crontabs*. When an instnace is suspended, the cron file is moved into */var/spool/cron/crontabs.disabled*

You can run the following command to see when user instance cron was started:

[source,bash]
---------------
cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "session opened for user osu" | grep CRON
---------------


=== Deactivation of all user instances

Use the scrip *make_instance_offline.sh* which deactivates all accesses by replacing every virtual host by one redirecting to a waiting page.

The same script can be used to reverse it.

[source,bash]
---------------
scripts/make_instance_offline.sh  https://myaccount.mydomain.com/offline.php  test|offline|online #replace FQDN and select appropriate command
---------------



=== Clean rubbish files

Launch the script: 

[source,bash]
---------------
/home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr/htdocs/custom/sellyoursaas/scripts/clean.sh confirm
---------------

Into field *sql to reset password*

[source,bash]
---------------
UPDATE llx_user set pass='__NEWUSERPASSWORD__', pass_crypted = '__NEWUSERPASSWORDCRYPTED__' where rowid = __INSTANCEID__;
---------------

=== Setup of Services

Services represent pricing policies.

You need to create an *Application* type service that will be linked to the *Package* to allow deployment.

The *Application* type service can then have other types of services like *Options* or *Statistics* in the *Virtual Product* tab.


Example of Application type service to deploy the Dolibarr ERP CRM PHP application:

image::Example_service_application.png[Exemple service application]

Example for a service adding pricing statistics by User:

image::Example_service_metric_USER.png[Exemple service metric]

Example for a service adding an option for more Go:

image::Example_service_option_GO.png[Exemple service option GO]


Note: *Options* and *Metrics* type services must be attached to an *Application* type service from the Virtual Products tab. 



=== Get the URL for subscription

Go to the menu *SellYourSaas - Subscription Pags* to get the URL for subscribing an instance (Application type package and its dependencies. 



=== Inner workings of a new SellYourSaas instance deployment

- The visitor goes to https://myaccount.mydomain.com/register.php , enters his email and chooses a URL for his instance (the URL can incorporate parameters to specify the subscribed service or the name of the vendor)

- By submitting on the subscription page, the following operations are triggered :
  * Check if third party exists or not. If not create the third party, if so tell to create the new instance from the customer dashboard.
  * Create a contract (main subscription) into database with status "DEPLOY_IN_PROGRESS" and with a Unix account name, pass, database account and pass, and other properties defined in the contract. The subscribed services are lines of contracts.
  * Calls instance deployment listener (micro web server serving only *scripts/remote_server/index.php* and executing the "deploy" on the deployment server (1 of the 6 remotes actions: "deploy" "undeploy", "suspend", "unsuspend", "refresh", "recreateauthorizedkeys") (in Dolibarr's case for instance, this calls the scripts *action_deploy_undeploy.sh* or *action_suspend_unsuspend.sh* according to the action code), to create/destroy or suspend/reactivate the client instance. See chapter <<remote_actions>>.
  * Edit contract/subscription with status "DEPLOYED" if result of remote action is OK.
  * Send an email to user: Show result to user and send en email (if subscriptions is done from backoffice, this option is off).


[[remote_actions]]
=== Description of the 8 remote actions

A remote action is an action requested by the server to the agent to be executed on the deployment server.

==== deploy / deployall

Steps realized by the agent and the remote action *deploy* or *deployall* are:

- Creates Unix user, pass and home with a restricted shell
- Adds a DNS entry
- Creates a database
- Creates database user with password and permissions to access the database.
- Creates a virtual host apache
- Deploys files with cp -pr pathToGitRepotOfPackage/* /home/jail/home/usrABCDEFGHIK/appAZERTYUIOP
- Deploy documents with cp -pr pathToGitRepoOfPackageBis/* /home/jail/home/usrABCDEFGHIK/appAZERTYUIOP
- Copies/creates/updates configuration files and updates them with all variables.
- Copies/creates/updates cron file and updates them with all variables.

==== undeploy / undeployall

Steps realized by the agent and the remote action *undeploy* are:

- All steps triggered by the "deploy" action are reversed (execpt for the first action : "undeploy" doesn't remove the Unix account, but "undeployall" does). 

==== suspend

Steps realized by the agent and the remote action *suspend* are:

- Deactivation of the virtual host and Apache reload.

The goal is to lock the access to the instace with a link to the dashboard to update the payment method, without changing the instance itself.

==== unsuspend

Steps realized by the agent and the remote action *unsuspend* are:

- Reactivation of the virtual host and Apache reload.

==== rename

Steps realized by the agent and the remote action *rename* are:

- Changes the domain name and/or the customized domain name (recreates the virtual host conf files).

==== refresh

Steps realized by the agent and the remote action *refresh* are:

- Calculates the shell metrics and returns the data.

==== backup

Steps realized by the agent and the remote action *backup* are:

- Calls the scripts backup_instance to backup an instance.

==== recreateauthorizedkeys

This remote action is used solely for Dolibarr ERP CRM. It's useless and unused for other software.

Steps realized by the agent and the remote action *recreateauthorizedkeys* are:

- Updates */etc/skel/authorized_keys_support* with the public keys passed as arguments.


=== Some business rules of Sell-Your-Saas

- The process that validates draft invoices does validate only one invoice per client at a time. If there are 2 waiting to be processed 2 runs of the invoice validation batch will be necessary to validate both.

- A recurrent process renews the end of contract date 1 or 2 days before the contract's expiry, provided there are no pending invoice for that client.

- If an instance expired more than N days ago (N is configurable and different for a user with a registered payment method), the suspension cron suspends the instance.

- If an instance is suspended since more than N days (M is configurable and different for a user with a registered payment method), the removal cron uninstalls the instance.

- When a user updates his payment method, we lookup pending invoices and try to get them paid. If it works, the payment method is validated, if not it is refused.

- When a bill is paid, if there are no more pending invoices and if the client was suspended, it is reactivated.

- If a client has an unpaid bill, the next bill remains in draft status.

- When an insntance is destroyed forever, the draft invoices linked to it are destroyed as well.

- The backups of the instances' databases and files are done only for paying SellYourSaas clients (having registered a payment method at least once).

== Annexes

=== Some common URLs for Web Analytics objectives or DataDog Statistics

To activate Web Analytics statistics (Google Analytics, Matomo, ...), put the tag in the configuration of the sellyoursaas module. Check that the domain name of your web site (https://www.mysellyoursaasdomain.com) and the domain of the customer area (https://myaccount.sellyoursaasdomain.com) are enabled.

To activate DataDog statistics, set the option into the module SellYourSaas:

This is a detail of events or URL that can be tracked:

* Page returned when we show the subscription form
- Name of event: Form to register
- URL: /register.php   (example: can be used as goal in *Google Analytics "Prospective client"*)                 
- Event DataDog: None

* Page shown after a completed subscription
- Name of event: Instance created
- URL: /index.php?welcomecid=   (example: can be used as goal in *Google Analytics "Subscribed client"*)                 
- Event DataDog: None

* Page shown when a payment method is added for the first time = New client
- Name of event: Payment mode added
- URL: /index.php?paymentrecorded=1   (example: can be used as goal in *Google Analytics "Won client"*)                 
- Event Datadog: *sellyoursaas.paymentmodeadded*

* Page shown when a payment method is modified with success
- Name of event: Payment mode modified
- URL: /index.php?paymentmodified=1
- Event Datadog: *sellyoursaas.paymentmodemodified*

* Payment done (with value 1)
- URL: None
- Event DataDog: *sellyoursaas.paymentdone*

* Payment done (with amount paid as value)
- URL: None
- Event DataDog: *sellyoursaas.payment*

* Client lose, when a paying instance is uninstalled (with value 1), whether automatically by the cron or upon client request from the client interface
- URL: None
- Event DataDog: *sellyoursaas.payingcustomerlost*

If you use an external db server (same value of "databasehost" and "databaseport" in sellyoursaas.conf)
* SELLYOURSAAS_FORCE_DATABASE_HOST = ip or host name of your external mysql server
* SELLYOURSAAS_FORCE_DATABASE_PORT = port of your external mysql server

If you use an ssh port other than 22
* SELLYOURSAAS_SSH_SERVER_PORT = port of your ssh server

If the path of "documents" directory (DOL_DATA_ROOT) is different in deployment server (same value of "newdoldataroot" in sellyoursaas.conf)
* SELLYOURSAAS_FORCE_DOL_DATA_ROOT = /path/of/dolibarr/documents/in/deployment/server

To activate Jailkit, a chroot security system (see Jailkit configuration)
* SELLYOURSAAS_SSH_JAILKIT_ENABLED = 1

=== Command ScaleWay

scw instance image list
scw instance server list

Create a new server:

scw instance server create type=DEV1-S zone=fr-par-1|nl-ams-1 image=ubuntu_focal name=remotebackupXscw \
    root-volume=l:10G [additional-volumes.0=l:10G] \
    tags.0=build_method=from-qcow2 \
    tags.1=disk_img_url=http://51.15.201.97/focal-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk-kvm.img \


=== Command to make a bind filesystem

bindfs /tmp /home/mylogin/mydir

fusermount -u /home/mylogin/mydir


=== Migrate a ext4 partition into btrfs

Run command to see partition types:

[source,bash]
---------------
df -Th
lsblk -f
---------------

If the data disk is ext4, you can convert it into BTRFS with:

[source,bash]
---------------
btrfs-convert -p /dev/vdX
lsblk -f
---------------

Then edit he */etc/fstab* to the type *ext4* to *btrfs* (change the UUID if it was changed)

Then you create a subvolume for each directory you want to be able to make snapshots.



=== TroubleShooting

==== Ping hangs in input, not in output

If you are using a server hosted on OpenStack, a security group may exists that block network in some direction/protocols.
Check that your security group match the following setup

image::Example_setup_security_group_horizon.png[Example of setup of security group on horizon]


==== ERROR "IMAP toolkit crash: unselectable socket in ssl_getdata()"

On deployment server in */var/log/syslog* when using IMAP PHP function:

  ERROR "IMAP toolkit crash: unselectable socket in ssl_getdata()"

=> Check that you have less than 1024 instances on same deployment server.
=> Check that error log file for instances is shared (instead one log file is open per instance with same unix account leading to troubles).


==== Error when sending email in */var/log/mail.log*, "type=A: Host not found" or "type=M: Host not found"

Error when sending email in */var/log/mail.log*:

	Mar  2 22:41:59 myservername.mysaasdomainname.com postfix/error[12146]: 7E69E17DC50: to=<admin@novafirstcloud5.localdomain>, orig_to=<admin>, relay=none, delay=164458, delays=164458/0.06/0/0, dsn=4.4.3, status=deferred (delivery temporarily suspended: Host or domain name not found. Name service error for name=smtp.seendgrid.net type=A: Host not found, try again)

=> Check you have a file */etc/resolv.conf* that is linked to ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf and that in content, it has an entry that point to local bind server so:

nameserver 127.0.0.1
or 
nameserver 127.0.0.56

If not, create it and restart postfix.


==== Error when sending email unknown user name value: postfix

Error when sending email in */var/log/mail.log*

	fatal: file /etc/postfix/main.cf: parameter mail_owner: unknown user name value: postfix
	
=> If the user *postfix* really exists into /etc/passwd, the trouble may be apparmor that does not allow reading the file */etc/passwd*

Check in file /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.apache2 that /etc/passwd is not denied.


==== php sessions files in /var/lib/php/sessions are not purged

php session purge can be done by 
[source,bash]
-------------
/etc/cron.d/php
-------------
or if systemd is available by
[source,bash]
-------------
systemctl status phpsessionclean.timer
-------------

Check the correct one is enabled.


==== Error fail2ban does not work on postfix-sasl rule

We found into log file /var/log/fail2ban.log

	2020-09-19 00:57:16,902 fail2ban.actions        [1182]: ERROR   Failed to execute ban jail 'postfix-sasl' action 'iptables-multiport' info 'ActionInfo
	
Edit the file /etc/fail2ban/jail/conf to replace *imap3* (it does not exists) into *imap* for rule postfix-sasl


==== Error when starting fail2ban

You can get more information by running 

sudo fail2ban-client -vvv -x start


==== Problem when starting mariadb / mariadb stop after a timetout

Launching mariadb launches the database but the command never returns to the command line prompt and the database is automatically stopped after few minutes.

Check the */var/log/kern.log*, you may have an apparmor error on /usr/sbin/mysqld.

If yes, disable the apparmor rule: 

aa-disable usr.sbin.mysqld

Then reboot server.


==== Extracting a zip file with file paths or names including backslash \

The problem is into the zip file (may be generated by the bugged Powershell). To solve this, try to unzip from command line with 

	unzip  file.zip

If it fails, you can fix path of extracted files with this command:

	for file in *\\*; do target="${file//\\//}"; mkdir -p "${target%/*}"; mv -v "$file" "$target"; done


==== Error Cannot open datafile during start of mysql

Example of logs:

2022-03-20T12:17:26.825916Z 0 [ERROR] InnoDB: Operating system error number 2 in a file operation.
2022-03-20T12:17:26.825955Z 0 [ERROR] InnoDB: The error means the system cannot find the path specified.
2022-03-20T12:17:26.825961Z 0 [ERROR] InnoDB: If you are installing InnoDB, remember that you must create directories yourself, InnoDB does not create them.
2022-03-20T12:17:26.825966Z 0 [ERROR] InnoDB: Cannot open datafile for read-only: './thedatabase/thefile.ibd' OS error: 71

The directory of a database may have been removed when the databases was not dropped.
Try to restart mysql. Once logged, do a CREATE DATABASE thedatabase; DROP DATABASE thedatabase;


==== Error 77 when using the option MAIN_ODT_AS_PDF to build PDF from ODT automatically

- Check the temp directory is writable by the web server user.
	

==== Error when doing PHP ssh2_connect or just ssh to a server

If you find into */var/log/auth.log* an error like:

... sshd[...]: Unable to negotiate with ... port ...: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 [preauth]

... sshd[...]: Unable to negotiate with ... port ...: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: ... [preauth]

The client (maybe an old PHP version) is using a deprecated algorithm for negotiation. Edit the file */etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/sellyoursaas.conf* of the target server by adding:

[source,bash]
---------------
# Legacy changes - To allow an old client to connect to
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa
HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +aes128-cbc
---------------

Then reload ssh with 

[source,bash]
---------------
/etc/init.d/ssh reload
---------------

To test if a couple client-server can work with one algorightm, you can try:

ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa admin@ip.of.server
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-ed25519 admin@ip.of.server


To use a different version of lib for PHP to make ssh2_connect, you can run Recompile libssh2 and Recompile php-ssh2:

[source,bash]
---------------
git clone https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2.git libssh2; cd libssh2; ./configure; make; make install;
git clone https://github.com/php/pecl-networking-ssh2.git php-ssh2; cd php-ssh2; phpize; ./configure --with-ssh2; make; make install; 
php -i | grep ssh2
restart
---------------

Even if php -i show the new version of library, a reboot may be required to have the new lib taken into account.


==== Some remote action generates a PHP coredump

This occurs on some distributions due to a bug in PHP method ssh2_disconnect().
You can disable the call to *ssh2_disconnect()* by setting constant SELLYOURSAAS_SSH2_DISCONNECT_DISABLED to 1


==== On a deployment server, the user root can read files into /home/admin/wwwroot/dolibarr_documents/sellyoursaas

Check that on the master server, the option *no_root_squash* is present into the file */var/exports*


==== Error when doing mysqldump (need PROCESS privileges)

mysqldump: Error: 'Access denied; you need (at least one of) the PROCESS privilege(s) for this operation' when trying to dump tablespaces

Try to add the parameter --no-tablespaces into the mysqldump command.


==== Error when doing mysqldump (max execution time exceeded)

mysqldump: Error 3024: 'Query execution was interrupted, maximum statement execution time exceeded when dumping table'

Try to read the *max_execution_time* of your database with:  

[source,sql]
---------------
show variables like '%max_execution_time%';
---------------

Then try to increase it with:  

[source,sql]
---------------
SET global max_execution_time = ...;    with millisecond 
---------------

Note: The change will be effective on next SQL connection. To have the change persistent after a reboot, you must edit the file */etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf*

See also chapter <<check_database_used>> to analyze the size of database. A table may be abnormaly large.


==== Error mysql when connecting to database

When logged with a customer linux account osu..., you get this error:
mysql -A -C -u dbu... -p'...' -h localhost -D dbn...
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (13)

Mariadb may try to use socket mode to connect to the database instead of IP. Try to replace "localhost" with "127.0.0.1" or add the parameter *--protocol tcp*.


==== Access to the console use the wrong keyboard

If after logged on a console, the keyboard is not in correct language, you can try this:

[source,bash]
---------------
loadkeys fr
---------------

You can also try 

[source,bash]
---------------
dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
---------------

First check with *parted /dev/xxx* and then *p* that you have a fat32 boot disk with *boot, esp* flag. If not do *set XX esp on*.

Retry. If it fails again, launch *debconf-get-selections | grep grub-efi* to know what is setup into debconf database for grub-common and grup-pc entry that use grub-efi.

If one point to the disk that does not exists mentionned into the error, edit the line to remove it and keep only the disk you need as boot devices with:

[source,bash]
---------------
cat << EOF | sudo debconf-set-selections
grub-common grub-efi/install_devices_disks_changed multiselect /dev/vda15
grub-pc grub-efi/install_devices_disks_changed multiselect /dev/vda15

==== Error mysqldump "Got a packet bigger than 'max_allowed_packet' bytes"

Try to read the *max_allowed_packet* of your database with:  

[source,sql]
---------------
show variables like '%max_allowed_packet%';
---------------

You can change this in live from mysql command tool:

[source,bash]
---------------
set global net_buffer_length=100000;
set global max_allowed_packet=100000000;
---------------

You can edit the section [mysqld] of the file *mysql.cnf* to increase this limits permanently

[source,bash]

# avoid error "Got a packet bigger than 'max_allowed_packet' bytes"
net_buffer_length=100000 
max_allowed_packet=100000000
---------------


==== Web request are slow due to maximum number of child reached

You may experience a too high number of child processed (reaching the maximum). You can see this on the
page https://supervision.mysaasdomainname.com/server-status
If most child are in state R, then you can try to reduce this by enabling the module ReqTimeout and set

[source,bash]
---------------
RequestReadTimeout handshake=5 header=10 body=30
